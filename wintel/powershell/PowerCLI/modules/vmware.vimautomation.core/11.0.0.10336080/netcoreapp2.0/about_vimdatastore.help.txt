SHORT DESCRIPTION
    The Datastore Provider (VimDatastore) provides filesystem-style view and
    access to the contents of datastores. The items in a datastore are files
    that contain configuration, virtual disk, and other data associated with a
    virtual machine. All file operations are case-sensitive.

LONG DESCRIPTION
    The Datastore Provider (VimDatastore) provides filesystem-style view and
    access to the contents of datastores. The items in a datastore are files
    that contain configuration, virtual disk, and other data associated with a
    virtual machine. All file operations are case-sensitive.
    Note that on VirtualCenter 2.0 and ESX 3.0 Datastore Provider supports only
    browsing and deleting items. On VirtualCenter 2.5 and ESX 3.5 all file
    operations are available, including moving, copying, and renaming items.

Default Datastore Drives
    When you connect to a server with Connect-VIServer, the cmdlet builds two
    default datastore drives. You can use the default drives or map custom
    drives based on the default ones.
    The first default drive is called "vmstores" and shows all datastores
    available on all vSphere servers connected within the current PowerCLI
    session. The hierarchy of the "vmstore" drive looks like that:
    1. vmstores - a common root for all connected vSphere servers
    2. <vSphere_server_name>
    3. Objects as they appear in the Datastores view of vClient
    4. Objects as they appear in the Datastores Browser component of vClient
    For example, the following is a valid "vmstores" datastore path:

    powershell
    vmstores:\ViServer1\Datacenter1\Datastore1\My WinXP\My WinXP.vmx

    The second drive is called "vmstore" and displays the datastores available
    only on the last connected vSphere server. The root of the "vmstore" drive
    is the last connected vSphere server. The hierarchy of the "vmstore" drive
    looks like that:
    1. <vSphere_server_name>
    2. Objects as they appear in the Datastores view of vClient
    3. Objects as they appear in the Datastores Browser component of vClient
    For example, the following is a valid "vmstore" datastore path:

    powershell
    vmstore:\Datacenter1\Datastore1\My WinXP\My WinXP.vmx

    The place where the Datastores view is glued to the Datastore Browser
    hierarchy is the datastore object (as part of the Datastores view) and the
    datastore root folder (as part of Datastore Browser hierarchy). Both are
    represented by the same provider location and a Datastore typed object is
    exposed at it. However, the location also supports datastore folder-specific
    operations such as receiving datastore files.

Custom Datastore Drives
    For their convenience, users can create custom datastore drives from
    existing paths. To create a custom datastore drive, use the New-PSDrive cmdlet.
    A different way to create a datastore drive is to use the New-DatastoreDrive
    command, which is an alias of New-PSDrive. It creates a new datastore drive
    using the Name and Datastore parameters.

Basic Operations with the Datastore Provider
    You can use the Datastore Provider to copy, rename, delete files, and move
    files between datastores and local directories.

EXAMPLES
Example 1: Creating custom datastore drive with different roots.
    New-PSDrive -Provider VIM -Name ds_a -Root vmstore:\Datacenter1
    New-PSDrive -Provider VIM -Name ds_ab -Root vmstore:\Datacenter1\Datastore1
    New-PSDrive -Provider VIM -Name ds_abc -Root vmstore:\Datacenter1\Datastore1\DsFolder1

Example 2: Creating a datastore drive by using the New-DatastoreDrive command:
    Get-Datastore Storage1 | New-DatastoreDrive -Name ds
    # To access the new drive, run:
    cd ds:
    # To list the drive content, use:
    Get-ChildItem

Example 3: Renaming a file in a datastore drive.
    cd VirtualMachines\XPVirtualMachine
    Rename-Item vmware-3.log vmware-3old.log

Example 4: Delete a file.
    Remove-Item ds:\VirtualMachines\XPVirtualMachine\vmware-2.log

Example 5: Copying a file to another datastore location:
    # 1. Create a new folder:
    New-Item -Path "ds:\VirtualMachines" -Name XPUpdates -ItemType Directory
    
    # 2. Copy the file to the new directory:
    Copy-Item "ds:\VirtualMachines\XPVirtualMachine\vmware-3old.log" "ds:\VirtualMachines\XPUpdates\vmware-3.log"

Example 6: Copy a file from the datastore drive to a local directory.
    Copy-DatastoreItem "ds:\VirtualMachines\XPVirtualMachine\vmware-3.log" "C:\Temp\vmware-3.log"

Example 7: Copy a file from the local machine to a location on the datastore drive.
    Copy-DatastoreItem "C:\Temp\vmware-3.log" "ds:\VirtualMachines\XPVirtualMachine\vmware-3new.log"
