# Protect security settings with Tamper Protection

**Applies to:**

- Windows 10

## Overview

During some kinds of cyber attacks, bad actors try to disable security features, such as anti-virus protection, on your machines. They do this to get easier access to your data, to install malware, or to otherwise exploit your data, identity, and devices. Tamper Protection helps prevent this from occurring. 

With Tamper Protection, malicious apps are prevented from taking actions like these:
- Disabling virus and threat protection
- Disabling real-time protection
- Turning off behavior monitoring
- Disabling antivirus (such as IOfficeAntivirus (IOAV))
- Disabling cloud-delivered protection
- Removing security intelligence updates

## How it works

 Tamper Protection essentially locks Microsoft Defender and prevents your security settings from being changed through apps and methods like these:
- Configuring settings in Registry Editor on your Windows machine 
- Changing settings through PowerShell cmdlets
- Editing or removing security settings through group policies
- and so on.

Tamper Protection doesn't prevent you from viewing your security settings. And, Tamper Protection doesn't affect how third-party antivirus apps register with the Windows Security app. If your organization is using Windows 10 Enterprise E5, individual users can't change the Tamper Protection setting; this is managed by your security team.

### What do you want to do?

[Turn Tamper Protection on (or off) for an individual machine using Windows Security](#turn-tamper-protection-on-or-off-for-an-individual-machine)

[Turn Tamper Protection on (or off) for your organization using Intune](#turn-tamper-protection-on-or-off-for-your-organization-using-intune)

## Turn Tamper Protection on (or off) for an individual machine

If you are a home user, or you are not subject to settings managed by a security team, you can use the Windows Security app to turn Tamper Protection on or off. You must have appropriate admin permissions on your machine to perform the following task.

1. Click **Start**, and start typing *Defender*. In the search results, select **Windows Security**.

2. Select **Virus & threat protection** > **Virus & threat protection settings**.

3. Set **Tamper Protection** to **On** or **Off**.

> [!NOTE]
> Tamper Protection blocks attempts to modify Windows Defender Antivirus settings through the registry.
> 
> To help ensure that Tamper Protection doesn’t interfere with third-party security products or enterprise installation scripts that modify these settings, go to **Windows Security** and update **Security intelligence** to version 1.287.60.0 or later. (See [Security intelligence updates](https://www.microsoft.com/wdsi/definitions).)
> 
> Once you’ve made this update, Tamper Protection will continue to protect your registry settings, and will also log attempts to modify them without returning errors.


## Turn Tamper Protection on (or off) for your organization using Intune

If you are part of your organization's security team, you can turn Tamper Protection on (or off) for your organization in the Microsoft 365 Device Management portal (Intune). (This feature is rolling out now; if you don't have it yet, you should very soon, assuming your organization has [Microsoft Defender ATP](../microsoft-defender-atp/whats-new-in-microsoft-defender-atp.md) and that you meet the prerequisites listed below.) 

You must have appropriate [permissions](../microsoft-defender-atp/assign-portal-access.md), such as global admin, security admin, or security operations, to perform the following task. 

1. Make sure your organization meets the following requirements:

See [Microsoft 365 Enterprise overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/enterprise/microsoft-365-overview) for more details.)
    - Your organization's devices must be managed by [Intune](https://docs.microsoft.com/intune/device-management-capabilities).
    - Your Windows machines must be running [Windows OS 1903](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/release-information/status-windows-10-1903) or later.
    - You must be using Windows security and update [security intelligence](https://www.microsoft.com/wdsi/definitions) to version 1.287.60.0 (or above)
    - Your machines must be using anti-malware platform version 4.18.1906.3 (or above) and anti-malware engine version 1.1.15500.X (or above). (See [Manage Windows Defender Antivirus updates and apply baselines](manage-updates-baselines-windows-defender-antivirus.md).)

3. Select **Device configuration** > **Profiles**.

4. Create a profile that includes the following settings:

    - **Platform**: Windows 10 and later
