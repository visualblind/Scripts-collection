2.  When the **InstallShield Wizard Welcome** screen appears, click **Next**.

3.  On the **License Agreement** screen, read the license agreement, click **I accept the terms in the license agreement**, and then click **Next**.

    The **Destination Folder** screen appears, with the default installation folder displayed.

    The default installation folder is *%systemdrive%\\Program Files\\Microsoft Enterprise Desktop Virtualization\\*.

    -   To change the folder where MED-V should be installed, click **Change** and browse to an existing folder.

4.  Click **Next**.

5.  On the **Ready to Install the Program** screen, click **Install**.

    The MED-V server installation starts. This can take several minutes, and the screen might not display text. During installation, several progress screens appear. If a message appears, follow the instructions provided.
