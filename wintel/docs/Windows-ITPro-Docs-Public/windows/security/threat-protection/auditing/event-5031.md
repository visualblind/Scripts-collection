***Event Description:***

This event generates when an application was blocked from accepting incoming connections on the network by [Windows Filtering Platform](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/aa366510(v=vs.85).aspx).

If you don’t have any firewall rules (Allow or Deny) in Windows Firewall for specific applications, you will get this event from [Windows Filtering Platform](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/aa366510(v=vs.85).aspx) layer, because by default this layer is denying any incoming connections.

> **Note**&nbsp;&nbsp;For recommendations, see [Security Monitoring Recommendations](#security-monitoring-recommendations) for this event.

## Security Monitoring Recommendations

For 5031(F): The Windows Firewall Service blocked an application from accepting incoming connections on the network.

-   You can use this event to detect applications for which no Windows Firewall rules were created.

-   If you have a pre-defined application which should be used to perform the operation that was reported by this event, monitor events with “**Application**” not equal to your defined application.

-   You can monitor to see if “**Application**” is not in a standard folder (for example, not in **System32** or **Program Files**) or is in a restricted folder (for example, **Temporary Internet Files**).

-   If you have a pre-defined list of restricted substrings or words in application names (for example, “**mimikatz**” or “**cain.exe**”), check for these substrings in “**Application**.”
