# Troubleshoot service issues

This section addresses issues that might arise as you use the Microsoft Defender Advanced Threat service.

## Server error - Access is denied due to invalid credentials
If you encounter a server error when trying to access the service, you’ll need to change your browser cookie settings.
Configure your browser to allow cookies.

## Elements or data missing on the portal
If some UI elements or data is missing on Microsoft Defender Security Center it’s possible that proxy settings are blocking it.

Make sure that `*.securitycenter.windows.com` is included the proxy whitelist.


> [!NOTE]
> You must use the HTTPS protocol when adding the following endpoints.
