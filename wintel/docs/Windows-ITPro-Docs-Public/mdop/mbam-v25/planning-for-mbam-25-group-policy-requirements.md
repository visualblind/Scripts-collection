### Support for the Used Space Encryption BitLocker policy

In MBAM 2.5 SP1, if you enable Used Space Encryption via BitLocker Group policy, the MBAM Client honors it.

This Group Policy setting is called **Enforce drive encryption type on operating system drives** and is located in the following GPO node: **Computer Configuration** &gt; **Administrative Templates** &gt; **Windows Components** &gt; **BitLocker Drive Encryption** &gt; **Operating System Drives**. If you enable this policy and select the encryption type as **Used Space Only encryption**, MBAM will honor the policy and BitLocker will only encrypt disk space that is used on the volume.

## How to get the MBAM Group Policy Templates and edit the settings


When you are ready to configure the MBAM Group Policy settings you want, do the following:

## Descriptions of the MBAM Group Policy settings


The **MDOP MBAM (BitLocker Management)** GPO node contains four global policy settings and four child GPO nodes: **Client Management**, **Fixed Drive**, **Operating System Drive**, and **Removable Drive**. The following sections describe and suggest settings for the MBAM Group Policy settings.

**Important**  
Do not change the Group Policy settings in the **BitLocker Drive Encryption** node, or MBAM will not work correctly. MBAM automatically configures the settings in this node for you when you configure the settings in the **MDOP MBAM (BitLocker Management)** node.

<li><p><strong>Select BitLocker recovery information to store</strong>. This policy setting lets you configure the key recovery service to back up BitLocker recovery information. It also lets you configure a status reporting service for collecting reports. The policy provides an administrative method of recovering data encrypted by BitLocker to prevent data loss due to the lack of key information. The status report and key recovery activity are automatically and silently sent to the configured report server location.</p>
<p>If you do not configure this policy setting or if you disable it, the key recovery information is not saved, and the status report and key recovery activity are not reported to the server. When this setting is set to <strong>Recovery Password and key package</strong>, the recovery password and key package are automatically and silently backed up to the configured key recovery server location.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Enter client checking status frequency in minutes</strong>. This policy setting manages how frequently the client checks the BitLocker protection policies and status on the client computer. This policy also manages how frequently the client compliance status is saved to the server. The client checks the BitLocker protection policies and status on the client computer and also backs up the client recovery key at the configured frequency.</p>
<p>Set this frequency based on the requirement set by your company on how frequently to check the compliance status of the computer and how frequently to back up the client recovery key.</p></li>

<td align="left"><p>Suggested configuration: <strong>Enabled</strong></p>
<p>This policy setting lets you manage whether the operating system drive must be encrypted.</p>
<p>For higher security, consider disabling the following policy settings in <strong>System</strong> &gt; <strong>Power Management</strong> &gt; <strong>Sleep Settings</strong> when you enable them with TPM + PIN protector:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Allow Standby States (S1-S3) When Sleeping (Plugged In)</p></li>
<li><p>Allow Standby States (S1-S3) When Sleeping (On Battery)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If you are running Microsoft Windows 8 or later, and you want to use BitLocker on a computer without a TPM, select the <strong>Allow BitLocker without a compatible TPM</strong> check box. In this mode, a password is required for startup. If you forget the password, you have to use one of the BitLocker recovery options to access the drive.</p>
<p>On a computer with a compatible TPM, two types of authentication methods can be used at startup to provide added protection for encrypted data. When the computer starts, it can use only the TPM for authentication, or it can also require the entry of a personal identification number (PIN).</p>
<p>If you enable this policy setting, users have to put the operating system drive under BitLocker protection, and the drive is then encrypted.</p>
<p>If you disable this policy, users cannot put the operating system drive under BitLocker protection. If you apply this policy after the operating system drive is encrypted, the drive is then decrypted.</p>
<p>If you do not configure this policy, the operating system drive is not required to be placed under BitLocker protection.</p></td>

<p>If you enable this policy setting, all new BitLocker startup PINs set will enable end user to create enhanced PINs. However, not all computers can support enhanced PINs in the pre-boot environment. We strongly recommend that administrators evaluate whether their systems are compatible with this feature before enabling its use.</p>
<p>Select the <strong>Require ASCII-only PINs</strong> check box to help make enhanced PINs more compatible with computers that limit the type or number of characters that can be entered in the pre-boot environment.</p>

<p>Use this policy setting to configure the number of days that users can postpone complying with MBAM policies for their operating system drive. The grace period begins when the operating system is first detected as noncompliant. After this grace period expires, users cannot postpone the required action or request an exemption from it.</p>

<p>Enable this policy setting to configure a custom recovery message or to specify a URL that is then displayed on the pre-boot BitLocker recovery screen when the OS drive is locked. This setting is only available on client computers running Windows 10.</p>
<p>When this policy is enabled, you can select one of these options for the pre-boot recovery message:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Use custom recovery message</strong>: Select this option to include a custom message in the pre-boot BitLocker recovery screen. In the <strong>Custom recovery message option</strong> box, type the message that you want displayed. If you also want to specify a recovery URL, include it as part of your custom recovery message.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Use custom recovery URL</strong>: Select this option to replace the default URL that is displayed in the pre-boot BitLocker recovery screen. In the <strong>Custom recovery URL option</strong> box, type the URL that you want displayed.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Use default recovery message and URL</strong>: Select this option to display the default BitLocker recovery message and URL in the pre-boot BitLocker recovery screen. If you previously configured a custom recovery message or URL and want to revert to the default message, you must enable this policy and select the <strong>Use default recovery message and URL</strong> option.</p></li>
</ul>

<strong>Note</strong><br/><p>Not all characters and languages are supported in pre-boot. We recommend that you test that the characters you use for the custom message or URL appear correctly on the pre-boot BitLocker recovery screen.</p>
