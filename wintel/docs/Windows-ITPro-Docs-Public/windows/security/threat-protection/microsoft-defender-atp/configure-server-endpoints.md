- System Center Configuration Manager 2012 / 2012 R2  1511 / 1602
- VDI onboarding scripts for non-persistent machines

For more information, see  [Onboard Windows 10 machines](configure-endpoints.md).

Support for Windows Server, version 1803 and Windows 2019 provides deeper insight into activities happening on the server, coverage for kernel and memory attack detection, and enables response actions on Windows Server endpoint as well. 

1. Configure Microsoft Defender ATP onboarding settings on the server. For more information, see [Onboard Windows 10 machines](configure-endpoints.md). 

2. If youâ€™re running a third party antimalware solution, you'll need to apply the following Windows Defender AV passive mode settings and verify it was configured correctly:

    a. Set the following registry entry:
       - Path: `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows Advanced Threat Protection`
       - Name: ForceDefenderPassiveMode
       - Value: 1

    b. Run the following PowerShell command to verify that the passive mode was configured:

       ```Get-WinEvent -FilterHashtable @{ProviderName="Microsoft-Windows-Sense" ;ID=84}```

    c. Confirm  that a recent event containing the passive mode event is found:
       
    ![Image of passive mode verification result](images/atp-verify-passive-mode.png)

3. Run the following command to check if Windows Defender AV is installed:

   ```sc query Windefend```

    If the result is â€˜The specified service does not exist as an installed serviceâ€™, then you'll need to install Windows Defender AV. For more information, see [Windows Defender Antivirus in Windows 10](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-antivirus/windows-defender-antivirus-in-windows-10).


## Integration with Azure Security Center
Microsoft Defender ATP integrates with Azure Security Center to provide a comprehensive server protection solution. With this integration Azure Security Center can leverage the power of Microsoft Defender ATP to provide improved threat detection for Windows Servers.

>[!NOTE]
>You'll need to have the appropriate license to enable this feature. 

The following capabilities are included in this integration:
- Automated onboarding - Microsoft Defender ATP sensor is automatically enabled on Windows Servers that are onboarded to Azure Security Center. For more information on Azure Security Center onboarding, see [Onboarding to Azure Security Center Standard for enhanced security](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security-center/security-center-onboarding).

    >[!NOTE]
    > Automated onboarding is only applicable for Windows Server 2012 R2 and Windows Server 2016.

- Servers monitored by  Azure Security Center will also be available in Microsoft Defender ATP - Azure Security Center seamlessly connects to the Microsoft Defender ATP tenant, providing a single view across clients and servers.  In addition, Microsoft Defender ATP alerts will be available in the Azure Security Center console.
- Server investigation -  Azure Security Center customers can access Microsoft Defender Security Center to perform detailed investigation to uncover the scope of a potential breach

>[!IMPORTANT]
>- When you use Azure Security Center to monitor servers, a Microsoft Defender ATP tenant is automatically created. The Microsoft Defender ATP data is stored in Europe by default. 
>- If you use Microsoft Defender ATP before using Azure Security Center, your data will be stored in the location you specified when you created your tenant even if you integrate with Azure Security Center at a later time.



## Offboard servers 
You can offboard Windows Server, version 1803 and Windows 2019 in the same method available for Windows 10 client machines. 

For other server versions, you have two options to offboard servers from the service:
- Uninstall the MMA agent
- Remove the Microsoft Defender ATP workspace configuration

>[!NOTE]
>Offboarding causes the server to stop sending sensor data to the portal but data from the server, including reference to any alerts it has had will be retained for up to 6 months.

### Uninstall servers by uninstalling the MMA agent
To offboard the server, you can uninstall the MMA agent from the server or detach it from reporting to your Microsoft Defender ATP workspace. After offboarding the agent, the server will no longer send sensor data to Microsoft Defender ATP.
For more information, see [To disable an agent](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/log-analytics/log-analytics-windows-agents#to-disable-an-agent).

### Remove the Microsoft Defender ATP workspace configuration
To offboard the server, you can use either of the following methods:

- Remove the Microsoft Defender ATP workspace configuration from the MMA agent 
- Run a PowerShell command to remove the configuration

#### Remove the Microsoft Defender ATP workspace configuration from the MMA agent 

1. In the **Microsoft Monitoring Agent Properties**, select the **Azure Log Analytics (OMS)** tab.

2. Select the Microsoft Defender ATP workspace, and click **Remove**.

    ```
    # Load agent scripting object
    $AgentCfg = New-Object -ComObject AgentConfigManager.MgmtSvcCfg
    # Remove OMS Workspace
    $AgentCfg.RemoveCloudWorkspace($WorkspaceID)
    # Reload the configuration and apply changes
    $AgentCfg.ReloadConfiguration()
    ```
