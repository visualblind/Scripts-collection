# Configuring Advanced Group Policy Management


In Advanced Group Policy Management (AGPM), as an AGPM Administrator (Full Control), you can centrally configure AGPM Server connections for Group Policy administrators, configure e-mail notification for AGPM, configure optional e-mail security for AGPM, delegate access to Group Policy Objects (GPOs) in the production environment, and configure logging and tracing for troubleshooting.
