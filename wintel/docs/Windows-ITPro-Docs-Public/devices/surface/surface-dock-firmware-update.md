# Microsoft Surface Dock Firmware Update

This article explains how to use Microsoft Surface Dock Firmware Update, newly redesigned to update Surface Dock firmware while running in the background on your Surface device. Once installed, it will update any Surface Dock attached to your Surface device. 

> [!NOTE]
>Microsoft Surface Dock Firmware Update supersedes the earlier Microsoft Surface Dock Updater tool, previously available for download as part of Surface Tools for IT. It was named Surface_Dock_Updater_vx.xx.xxx.x.msi (where x indicates the version of the tool). The earlier tool has been retired, is no longer available for download, and should not be used.

## To run Surface Dock Firmware Update

1. Download and install [Microsoft Surface Dock Firmware Update](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=46703).
    - The file is released in the following naming format: **Surface_Dock_FwUpdate_X.XX.XXX_Win10_XXXXX_XX.XXX.XXXXX_X.MSI** and installs by default to C:\Program Files\SurfaceUpdate.
    - Requires Surface devices running at least Windows 10 version 1803 or later.

2. After you connect Surface Dock to your Surface device, the tool checks the firmware status while running in the background.
 
4. After several seconds, disconnect your Surface Dock from your device and then wait for 5 seconds before reconnecting. The Surface Dock Firmware Update will normally update the dock silently in background after you disconnect from the dock and reconnect. The process can take a few minutes to complete and will continue even if interrupted. 

### Manual installation
If preferred, you can manually complete the update as follows:

- Reconnect your Surface Dock for 2 minutes and then disconnect it from your device. The DisplayPort firmware update will be installed while the hardware is disconnected. The LED in the Ethernet port of the dock will blink while the update is in progress. Please wait until the LED stops blinking before you unplug your Surface Dock from power.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - Manually installing the MSI file may prompt you to restart Surface; however, restarting is optional and not required.
>- You will need to disconnect and reconnect the dock twice before the update fully completes.

## Network deployment

You can use Windows Installer commands (Msiexec.exe) to deploy Surface Dock Firmware Update to multiple devices across your network. When using System Center Configuration Manager or other deployment tool, enter the following syntax to ensure the installation is silent:

- **Msiexec.exe /i <name of msi> /quiet /norestart**

For more information, refer to [Command line options](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/win32/msi/command-line-options) documentation.

## How to verify completion of firmware update

Surface dock firmware consists of two components:

- **Component10:** Micro controller unit (MCU) firmware
- **Component20:** Display port (DP) firmware.

Successful completion of Surface Dock Firmware Update results in new registry key values for these firmware components.

**To verify updates:**

1. Open Regedit and navigate to the following registry path:

- **HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\WUDF\Services\SurfaceDockFwUpdate\Parameters**

2. Look for the registry keys: **Component10CurrentFwVersion and Component20CurrentFwVersion**, which refer to the firmware that is currently on the device.

3. Verify the new registry key values match the updated registry key values listed in the Versions reference at the end of this document. If the values match, the firmware was updated successfully.

4. If unable to verify, review Event logging and Troubleshooting tips in the next section.

## Event logging

**Table 1. Event logging for Surface Dock Firmware Update**

## Troubleshooting tips

- Completely disconnect power for Surface dock from the AC power to reset the Surface Dock.
- Disconnect all peripherals except for the Surface Dock.
- Uninstall any current Surface Dock Firmware Update and then install the latest version.
- Ensure that the Surface Dock is disconnected, and then allow enough time for the update to complete as monitored via an LED in the Ethernet port of the dock. Wait until the LED stops blinking before you unplug Surface Dock from power.
- Connect the Surface Dock to a different device to see if it is able to update the dock.
