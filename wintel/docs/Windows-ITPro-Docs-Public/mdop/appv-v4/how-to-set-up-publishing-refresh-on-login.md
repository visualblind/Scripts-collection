# How to Set Up Publishing Refresh on Login


You can use the following procedure to configure the Application Virtualization (App-V) Client to refresh the publishing information from the server each time you log in to the computer. After the client is configured, the refresh operation is automatic.

**To refresh the publishing information on login**

1.  Click **Publishing Servers** in the **Scope** pane.

2.  In the **Results** pane, right-click the desired server and select **Properties** from the pop-up-menu.

3.  In the **Properties** dialog box, on the **Refresh** tab, select the **Refresh configuration server on user login** check box.

4.  Click **Apply** to change the configuration.

5.  When you finish configuring the settings, click **OK** to exit the dialog box and return to the Application Virtualization Management Console.

    The publishing information will now be refreshed each time you log in to the system.
