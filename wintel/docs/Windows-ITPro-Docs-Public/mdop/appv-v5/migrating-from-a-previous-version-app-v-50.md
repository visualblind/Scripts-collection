# Migrating from a Previous Version


With App-V 5.0 you can migrate your existing App-V 4.6 infrastructure to the more flexible, integrated, and easier to manage App-V 5.0 infrastructure.

Consider the following sections when you plan your migration strategy:

**Note**  
For more information about the differences between App-V 4.6 and App-V 5.0, see the **Differences between App-V 4.6 and App-V 5.0 section** of [About App-V 5.0](about-app-v-50.md).

 

## Converting packages created using a prior version of App-V


Use the package converter utility to upgrade virtual application packages created using previous versions of App-V. The package converter uses PowerShell to convert packages and can help automate the process if you have many packages that require conversion.

**Important**  
After you convert an existing package you should test the package prior to deploying the package to ensure the conversion process was successful.

 

**What to know before you convert existing packages**

</tr>

When converting a package check for failing files or shortcuts. Locate the item in App-V 4.6 package. It could possibly be hard-coded path. Convert the path.

**Note**  
It is recommended that you use the App-V 5.0 sequencer for converting critical applications or applications that need to take advantage of features. See, [How to Sequence a New Application with App-V 5.0](how-to-sequence-a-new-application-with-app-v-50-beta-gb18030.md).

If a converted package does not open after you convert it, it is also recommended that you re-sequence the application using the App-V 5.0 sequencer.

## Migrating Clients


The following table displays the recommended method for upgrading clients.

**Important**  
You must be running App-V 4.6 SP3 to use coexistence mode. Additionally, when you sequence a package, you must configure the Managing Authority setting, which is in the **User Configuration** is located in the **User Configuration** section.

 

## Migrating the App-V 5.0 Server Full Infrastructure


There is no direct method to upgrade to a full App-V 5.0 infrastructure. Use the information in the following section for information about upgrading the App-V server.

## Additional Migration tasks


You can also perform additional migration tasks such as reconfiguring end points as well as opening a package created using a prior version on a computer running the App-V 5.0 client. The following links provide more information about performing these tasks.
