# How to deploy App-V 5.0 Packages Using Electronic Software Distribution


You can use an electronic software distribution (ESD) system to deploy App-V 5.0 virtual applications to App-V clients. For details, see the documentation available with the ESD you are using.

For component requirements and options for using an ESD to deploy App-V packages, see [Planning to Deploy App-V 5.0 with an Electronic Software Distribution System](planning-to-deploy-app-v-50-with-an-electronic-software-distribution-system.md).

Use one of the following methods to publish packages to App-V client computers with an ESD:

The Windows Installer file contains the associated App-V 5.0 package file information used to configure a package and copies the required package files to the client.</p></td>

**To deploy App-V 5.0 packages by using an ESD**

1.  Install the App-V 5.0 Sequencer on a computer in your environment. For more information about installing the sequencer, see [How to Install the Sequencer](how-to-install-the-sequencer-beta-gb18030.md).

2.  Use the App-V 5.0 Sequencer to create virtual application. For information about creating a virtual application, see [Creating and Managing App-V 5.0 Virtualized Applications](creating-and-managing-app-v-50-virtualized-applications.md).

3.  After you create the virtual application, deploy the package by using your ESD solution.

    If you are using System Center Configuration Manager, start by reviewing [Introduction to Application Management in Configuration Manager](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=281816) for information about using App-V 5.0 and System CenterÂ 2012 Configuration Manager.
