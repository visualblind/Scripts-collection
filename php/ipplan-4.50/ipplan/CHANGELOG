Nov 17, 2005
-  ipplan:      added: automatically create a DNS A record on modification of
			IP record with hostname field matching a domain name
			of a zone - requested by joelg
			this option is controlled by the config.php option

			A records
		fixed: creating a subnet did not update the hostname field when
			using the "Add active hosts using NMAP" and "Add host 
			names from DNS" options - bug reported by ravinald
		fixed: latest nmap 3.93 adds MAC addresses to XML which broke
			detection of IP addresses correctly
		added: nmap 3.93 MAC addresses are added to macaddress field if
			available during subnet creation and import of addresses

			createsubnet will not normally see this field unless
			nmap is chmod +s - not a good idea!
