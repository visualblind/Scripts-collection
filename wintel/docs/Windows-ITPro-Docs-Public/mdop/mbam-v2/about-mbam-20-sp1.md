# About MBAM 2.0 SP1


This topic describes the changes in Microsoft BitLocker Administration and Monitoring (MBAM) 2.0 Service Pack 1 (SP1). For a general description of MBAM, see [Getting Started with MBAM 2.0](getting-started-with-mbam-20-mbam-2.md).

## <a href="" id="what-s-new-in-mbam-2-0-sp1"></a>What’s new in MBAM 2.0 SP1


This version of MBAM provides the following new features and functionality.

### Support for Windows 8.1, Windows Server 2012 R2, and System Center 2012 R2 Configuration Manager

Microsoft BitLocker Administration and Monitoring (MBAM) 2.0 Service Pack 1 (SP1) adds support for Windows 8.1, Windows Server 2012 R2, and System Center 2012 R2 Configuration Manager.

### Support for Microsoft SQL Server 2008 R2 SP2

Microsoft BitLocker Administration and Monitoring (MBAM) 2.0 Service Pack 1 (SP1) adds support for Microsoft SQL Server 2008 R2 SP2. You must use Microsoft SQL Server 2008 R2 or higher if you are running Microsoft System Center Configuration Manager 2007 R2.

### Customer feedback rollup

MBAM 2.0 SP1 includes a rollup of fixes to address issues that were found since the Microsoft BitLocker Administration and Monitoring (MBAM) 2.0 release. As part of these changes, the Computer Name field now appears in the BitLocker Computer Compliance and BitLocker Enterprise Compliance Details reports when you run MBAM with Microsoft System Center Configuration Manager 2007.

### Firewall exception must be set on ports for the Self-Service Portal and the Administration and Monitoring website

When you configure the Self-Service Portal and the Administration and Monitoring website, you must set a firewall exception to enable communication through the specified ports. Previously, the MBAM server installation opened the ports automatically in Windows Firewall.

### Location of MBAM reports has changed in Configuration Manager

MBAM reports for the Configuration Manager integrated topology are now available under subfolders within the MBAM node. The subfolder names represent the language of the reports within the subfolder.

### Ability to install MBAM on a primary site server when you install MBAM with Configuration Manager

You can install MBAM on a primary site server or a central administration site server when you install MBAM with the Configuration Manager integrated topology. Previously, you were required to install MBAM on a central administration site server.

**Important**  
The server on which you install MBAM must be the top-tier server in your hierarchy.



The MBAM installation works differently for Microsoft System Center Configuration Manager 2007 and Microsoft System Center 2012 Configuration Manager as follows:

-   **Configuration Manager 2007** : If you install MBAM on a primary site server that is part of a larger Configuration Manager hierarchy and has a central site parent server, MBAM resolves the central site parent server and performs all of the installation actions on that parent server. The installation actions include checking prerequisites and installing the Configuration Manager objects and reports. For example, if you install MBAM on a primary site server that is a child of a central site parent server, MBAM installs all of the Configuration Manager objects and reports on the parent server. If you install MBAM on the parent server, MBAM performs all of the installation actions on that parent server.

-   **System Center 2012 Configuration Manager** : If you install MBAM on a primary site server or on a central administration server, MBAM performs all of the installation actions on that site server.

### <a href="" id="-------------configuration-manager-console-must-be-installed-on-the--computer-on-which-you-install-the-mbam-server"></a> Configuration Manager Console must be installed on the computer on which you install the MBAM Server

When you install MBAM with the Configuration Manager integrated topology, you must install the Configuration Manager Console on the same computer on which MBAM will be installed. If you use the recommended architecture, which is described in [Getting Started - Using MBAM with Configuration Manager](getting-started---using-mbam-with-configuration-manager.md), you would install MBAM on the Configuration Manager Primary Site Server.

### Ability to turn Self-Service Portal notice text on or off

MBAM 2.0 SP1 enables you to turn off the notice text on the Self-Service Portal. Previously, the notice text displayed by default, and you could not turn it off.

**To turn off the notice text**

1.  On the server where you installed the Self-Service Portal, open Internet Information Services (IIS) and browse to **Sites &gt; Microsoft BitLocker Administration and Monitoring &gt; SelfService &gt; Application Settings**.

2.  From the **Name** column, select **DisplayNotice**, and set the value to **false**.

### Ability to localize the HelpdeskText statement that points users to more Self-Service Portal information

You can configure a localized version of the Self-Service Portal “HelpdeskText” statement, which tells end users how to get additional help when they are using the Self-Service Portal. If you configure localized text for the statement, as described in the following instructions, MBAM will display the localized version. If MBAM does not find the localized version, it displays the value that is in the **HelpdeskText** parameter.

**To display a localized version of the HelpdeskText statement**

1.  On the server where you installed the Self-Service Portal, open IIS and browse to **Sites &gt; Microsoft BitLocker Administration and Monitoring &gt; SelfService &gt; Application Settings**.

2.  In the **Actions** pane, click **Add** to open the **Add Application Setting** dialog box.

3.  In the **Name** field, type **HelpdeskText**\_&lt;*language*&gt;, where &lt;*language*&gt; is the appropriate language code for the text. For example, to create a localized HelpdeskText statement in Spanish, you would name the parameter HelpdeskText\_es-es. For a list of the valid language codes that you can use, see [National Language Support (NLS) API Reference](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=317947).

4.  In the **Value** field, type the localized text that you want to display to end users.

### Ability to localize the Self-Service Portal HelpdeskURL

You can configure a localized version of the Self-Service Portal HelpdeskURL to display to end users by default. If you create a localized version, as described in the following instructions, MBAM finds and displays the localized version. If MBAM does not find a localized version, it displays the URL that is configured for the HelpDeskURL parameter.

**To display a localized HelpdeskURL**

1.  On the server where you installed the Self-Service Portal, open IIS and browse to **Sites &gt; Microsoft BitLocker Administration and Monitoring &gt; SelfService &gt; Application Settings**.

2.  In the **Actions** pane, click **Add** to open the **Add Application Setting** dialog box.

3.  In the **Name** field, type **HelpdeskURL**\_&lt;*language*&gt;, where &lt;*language*&gt; is the appropriate language code for the URL. For example, to create a localized HelpdeskURL in Spanish, you would name the parameter HelpdeskURL\_es-es. For a list of the valid language codes you can use, see [National Language Support (NLS) API Reference](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=317947).

4.  In the **Value** field, type the localized HelpdeskURL that you want to display to end users.

### Ability to localize the Self-Service Portal notice text

You can configure localized notice text to display to end users by default in the Self-Service Portal. The notice.txt file, which displays the notice text, is located in the following root directory:

&lt;*MBAM Self-Service Install Directory*&gt;\\Self Service Website\\

To display localized notice text, you create a localized notice.txt file and save it under a specific language folder in the following directory:

&lt;*MBAM Self-Service Install Directory*&gt;\\Self Service Website\\

MBAM displays the notice text, based on the following rules:

-   If you create a localized notice.txt file in the appropriate language folder, MBAM displays the localized notice text.

-   If MBAM does not find a localized version of the notice.txt file, it displays the text in the default notice.txt file.

-   If MBAM does not find a default notice.txt file, it displays the default text in the Self-Service Portal.

**Note**  
If an end user’s browser is set to a language that does not have a corresponding language subfolder or notice.txt, the text that is in the notice.txt file in the following root directory is displayed:

&lt;*MBAM Self-Service Install Directory*&gt;\\Self Service Website\\



**To create a localized notice.txt file**

1.  On the server where you installed the Self-Service Portal, create a &lt;*language*&gt; folder in the following directory, where &lt;*language*&gt; represents the name of the localized language:

    &lt;*MBAM Self-Service Install Directory*&gt;\\Self Service Website\\

    **Note**  
    Some language folders already exist, so you may not have to create one. If you do need to create a language folder, see [National Language Support (NLS) API Reference](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=317947) for a list of the valid names that you can use for the &lt;*language*&gt; folder.



2.  Create a notice.txt file that contains the localized notice text.

3.  Save the notice.txt file in the &lt;*language*&gt; folder. For example, to create a localized notice.txt file in Spanish, you would save the localized notice.txt file in the following folder:

    &lt;*MBAM Self-Service Install Directory*&gt;\\Self Service Website\\es-es

## Upgrading to MBAM 2.0 SP1


You can upgrade to MBAM 2.0 SP1 from any previous version of MBAM.

### Upgrading the MBAM infrastructure

You can upgrade the MBAM Server infrastructure to MBAM 2.0 SP1 as follows:

**Manual in-place server replacement**: You must manually uninstall the existing MBAM Server infrastructure, and then install the MBAM 2.0 SP1 Server infrastructure. You do not have to remove the databases to do the upgrade. Instead, you select the existing databases, which the previous version of MBAM created. The MBAM 2.0 SP1 upgrade installation then migrates the existing databases to MBAM 2.0 SP1.

**Distributed client upgrade**: If you are using the Stand-alone MBAM topology, you can upgrade the MBAM Clients gradually after you install the MBAM 2.0 SP1 Server infrastructure.

After you upgrade the MBAM Server infrastructure, MBAM 1.0 or 2.0 Clients will report to the MBAM 2.0 SP1 Server successfully and will store the recovery data, but compliance will be based on the policies available for the MBAM Client version that is currently installed. To enable reporting against MBAM 2.0 SP1 policies, you must upgrade client computers to MBAM 2.0 SP1. You can upgrade the client computers to the MBAM 2.0 SP1 Client without uninstalling the previous Client, and the Client will start to apply and report, based on the MBAM 2.0 SP1 policies.

For more information about upgrading the MBAM servers, see [Upgrading from Previous Versions of MBAM](upgrading-from-previous-versions-of-mbam.md).

### Upgrading the MBAM Client to MBAM 2.0 SP1

To upgrade end-user computers to the MBAM 2.0 SP1 Client, run **MbamClientSetup.exe** on each client computer. The installer automatically updates the Client to the MBAM 2.0 SP1 Client. After the installation, client computers do not have to be rebooted, and the MBAM 2.0 SP1 Client starts to apply and report against MBAM 2.0 SP1 policies.

If you are using MBAM with Configuration Manager, you must upgrade the MBAM client computers to MBAM 2.0 SP1.

For more information about upgrading the MBAM client computers, see [Upgrading from Previous Versions of MBAM](upgrading-from-previous-versions-of-mbam.md).

## Installing or upgrading to MBAM 2.0 SP1 with Configuration Manager


This section describes the requirements when you are installing MBAM 2.0 SP1 as a new installation or as an upgrade to a previous MBAM 2.0 SP1 installation.

### Required files for installing MBAM 2.0 SP1 if you are using MBAM with Configuration Manager

If you are installing MBAM for the first time and you are using MBAM 2.0 SP1 with System Center Configuration Manager, you must create or edit mof files to enable MBAM to work correctly with Configuration Manager.

-   **configuration.mof file**

    -   If you are using Configuration Manager 2007, you must edit the configuration.mof file by completing step 3 from the item **Update the configuration.mof file if you upgrade to MBAM 2.0 SP1 and you are using MBAM with Configuration Manager 2007**, which follows this item.

    -   If you are using System Center 2012 Configuration Manager, edit the configuration.mof file by following the instructions in [Edit the Configuration.mof File](edit-the-configurationmof-file.md).

-   **sms\_def.mof file** – follow the instructions in [Create or Edit the Sms\_def.mof File](create-or-edit-the-sms-defmof-file.md).

### Update the configuration.mof file if you upgrade to MBAM 2.0 SP1 and you are using MBAM with Configuration Manager 2007

If you are upgrading to MBAM 2.0 SP1 and you are using MBAM with Configuration Manager 2007, you must update the configuration.mof file to ensure that MBAM 2.0 SP1 works correctly.

**To update the configuration.mof file:**

1.  On the Configuration Manager Server, browse to the location of the Configuration.mof file:

    &lt;CMInstallLocation&gt;\\Inboxes\\clifiles.src\\hinv\\

    On a default installation, the installation location is %systemdrive%\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Configuration Manager.

2.  Review the block of code that you appended to the configuration.mof file, and delete it. The block of code will be similar to the one shown in the following step.

3.  Copy the following block of code, and then append it to the configuration.mof file to add the following required MBAM classes to the file:

    ``` syntax
