# Share your HoloLens with multiple people

It's common to share one HoloLens with many people or to have many people share a set of HoloLens devices.  This article describes the different ways in which you can share a device.

## Share with multiple people, each using their own account

When they use their own Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) accounts, multiple users can each keep their own user settings and user data on the device.

To make sure that multiple people can use their own accounts on your HoloLens, follow these steps to configure it:

1. Make sure the the device is running Windows 10, version 1803 or later.
   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > If you are using a HoloLens (1st gen) device, [upgrade the device to Windows Holographic for Business](hololens1-upgrade-enterprise.md).
1. When you set up the device, select **My work or school owns it** and sign in by using an Azure AD account.
1. After you finish setup, make sure that the account settings (**Settings** > **Accounts**) includes **Other users**.

To use HoloLens, each user follows these steps:

1. If another user has been using the device, do one of the following:
   - Press the power button once to go to standby, and then press the power button again to return to the lock screen
   - Select the user tile on the upper right of the Pins panel to sign out the current user.

1. Use your Azure AD account credentials to sign in to the device.  
    If this is the first time that you have used the device, you have to [calibrate](hololens-calibration.md) HoloLens to your own eyes.

To see a list of the device users or to remove a user from the device, go to **Settings** > **Accounts** > **Other users**.

## Share with multiple people, all using the same account

Multiple users can also share a HoloLens device while using a single user account.

**On HoloLens 2**, when a new user puts the device on their head for the first time (while keeping the same account signed in), the device prompts the new user to quickly calibrate and personalize the viewing experience. The device can store the calibration information so that in the future, the device can automatically optimize the quality and comfort of each user's viewing experience. The users do not need to calibrate the device again.

**On HoloLens (1st gen)** users sharing an account will need to ask to recalibrate in the Settings app.  Read more about [calibration](hololens-calibration.md).
