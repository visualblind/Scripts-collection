# Accessibility for App-V 5.0


Microsoft is committed to making its products and services easier for everyone to use. This section provides information about features and services that make this product and its corresponding documentation more accessible for people with disabilities.

## Access Any Command with a Few Keystrokes


**Important**  
The information in this section only applies to the App-V 5.0 sequencer. For specific information about the App-V 5.0 server, see the Keyboard Shortcuts for the App-V 5.0 Management Server section of this document.

 

Access keys let you quickly use a command by pressing a few keys. You can get to most commands by using two keystrokes. To use an access key:

1.  Press ALT.

    The keyboard shortcuts are displayed over each feature that is available in the current view.

2.  Press the letter shown in the keyboard shortcut over the feature that you want to use.

**Note**  
To cancel the action that you are taking and hide the keyboard shortcuts, press ALT.
