# How to Create a Connection Group with User-Published and Globally Published Packages
You can create user-entitled connection groups that contain both user-published and globally published packages, using either of the following methods:

-   [How to use PowerShell cmdlets to create the user-entitled connection groups](#bkmk-posh-userentitled-cg)

-   [How to use the App-V Server to create the user-entitled connection groups](#bkmk-appvserver-userentitled-cg)

**What to know before you start:**

<tr class="even">
<td align="left"><p>If you publish a package globally and then create a user-published connection group in which you’ve made that package non-optional, you can still run <strong>Unpublish-AppvClientPackage &lt;package&gt; -global</strong> to unpublish the package, even when that package is being used in another connection group.</p></td>
<td align="left"><p>If any other connection groups are using that package, the package will fail in those connection groups.</p>
<p>To avoid inadvertently unpublishing a non-optional package that is being used in another connection group, we recommend that you track the connection groups in which you’ve used a non-optional package.</p></td>
