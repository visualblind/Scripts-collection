# Linshare-Docker

> Docker is available [here](https://www.docker.com/products/docker) and docker-compose [here](https://docs.docker.com/compose).
> Make sure that these are installed on your system before starting.

* Docker can be installed with the following lines on most distros :

```bash
$ curl -sSL https://get.docker.com | sudo curl
```

* docker-compose :

you can install it according to the offcial documentaion [here](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

### Presentation

    Deploy a Linshare instance with ease using Docker and docker-compose

This docker-compose aims to make possible to quickly run a Linshare appliance.
It consists of several containers :

* Tomcat with Linshare server
* Postgresql for the server
* MongoDB for the server
* Apache2 with Linshare Admin's interface
* Apache2 with Linshare User's interface
* Apache2 with Linshare Upload request's interface
* Apache2 acting as a reverse-proxy for the above (except Postgresql & MongoDB)
* Thumbnail server to generate preview for input files on Linshare
* Opensmtp server configured in relay mode
* ClamAV server to be used by Tomcat
* LDAP directory containing some sample users. [see](https://github.com/linagora/linshare-ldap-for-tests-dockerfile)
* An init container: it will create a domain with a connexion to the embedded
  LDAP.

Most of the containers can be configured to suits your needs, the available settings are either already used (and you have just to replace them) or commented out.
Automatic upgrades for data used by containers is not available.

### How to use it

```bash
# use this line to launch it
$ docker-compose up -d

# Once containers are created and running in backgroup, you must check if they are running properly:
$ docker-compose ps
# If a container exits with an error code different than 0, it means it failed.
# In this case, you should take a look to the container.

# use this line to see logs for all containers
$ docker-compose logs

# use this line to stop
$ docker-compose stop

# use this line to delete previously created containers
$ docker-compose down

# use this line to delete all data created by containers (reset all modifications)
$ sudo rm -fr data
```

By default the containers are listenning to **linshare.local** so you may have to add the following lines in your hosts file :

```bash
127.0.0.1   admin.linshare.local user.linshare.local linshare.local traefik.linshare.local webmail.linshare.local upload-request.linshare.local docs.linshare.local
```

And all uses the ```https``` protocol via the port 443.

### Quick start

Once everything is running, you can start using LinShare [home page](https://linshare.local).

If you do not want to use the init container, you can setup the link with the
LDAP manually with the following guide:
1. Browse to [admin.linshare.local](https://admin.linshare.local) and log in using
    - mail : **root@localhost.localdomain**
    - password : **adminlinshare**
2. Select **Domain** &rarr; **LDAP connections**
    - Click on the '**+**' icon
    - Fill the fields with your LDAP credentials
    - Hit **Save**
3. Select **Domain** &rarr; **Domain patterns**
    - In **Model selector** chose **default-pattern-demo**
    - Fill the field **Name**
    - Hit **Save**
4. Select **Domain** &rarr; **Manage domains**
    - Click on the '**+**' button after **LinShareRootDomain**
    - Fill the fields **Identifier**, **Name** and **Description**
    - Leave **Inter-domains communication rules** to ```DefaultDomainPolicy```
    - Select the wanted settings for the remaining fields
    - Click on **Add provider**
    - Select the previous created elements in **step 2** and **step 3** for each fields and provide your **Base dn** in the last one
    - Hit **Save**
5. You can now go [user.linshare.local](https://user.linshare.local/) and start using your LDAP users.
