# Enable the DLL rule collection

**Applies to**
- Windows 10
- Windows Server

This topic for IT professionals describes the steps to enable the DLL rule collection feature for AppLocker.

The DLL rule collection includes the .dll and .ocx file formats.

For info about these rules, see [DLL rules in AppLocker](dll-rules-in-applocker.md).

You can perform this task by using the Group Policy Management Console for an AppLocker policy in a Group Policy Object (GPO) or by using the Local Security Policy snap-in for an AppLocker policy on a local computer or in a security template. For info how to use these MMC snap-ins to administer 
AppLocker, see [Administer AppLocker](administer-applocker.md#bkmk-using-snapins).

**To enable the DLL rule collection**
1.  From the AppLocker console, right-click **AppLocker**, and then click **Properties.**
2.  Click the **Advanced** tab, select the **Enable the DLL rule collection** check box, and then click **OK**.

    >**Important:**  Before you enforce DLL rules, make sure that there are allow rules for each DLL that is used by any of the allowed apps.
