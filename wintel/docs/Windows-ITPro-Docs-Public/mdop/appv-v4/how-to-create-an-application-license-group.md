You can use the following procedure to create an application license group.

2.  Select one of the following menu items that corresponds to the type of license group you want to create, and complete the pages in the associated **New License Wizard**:

    1.  **New Unlimited License**

    2.  **New Concurrent License**

    3.  **New Named License**

3.  Click **Finish**.
