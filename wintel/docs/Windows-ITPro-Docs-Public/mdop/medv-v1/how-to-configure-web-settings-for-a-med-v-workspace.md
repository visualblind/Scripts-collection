# How to Configure Web Settings for a MED-V Workspace


Web sites that can only be displayed in older versions of Internet Explorer and that do not exist in the host operating system can be viewed in older versions of Internet Explorer within the MED-V workspace. The user does not need to open a browser in the MED-V workspace to view the specified Web sites. The user can open a browser on the host and automatically be redirected to the MED-V workspace and vice versa.

The following procedures describe how you can set a list of Web browsing rules for a MED-V workspace. All sites included in the rules can be browsed either in the MED-V workspace or on the host, as defined by the administrator. All sites not defined within the rules are browsed from the environment in which they were requested. However, you can configure them as a group as well, to be browsed in the MED-V workspace or the host.

**Note**  
Web settings are applied only to Internet Explorer and to no other browsers.



All Web settings are configured in the **Policy** module, on the **Web** tab.
