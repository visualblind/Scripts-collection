# Restart, reset, or recover HoloLens

Here are some things to try if your HoloLens is unresponsive, isn’t running well, or is experiencing software or update problems.

## Restart your HoloLens

If your HoloLens isn’t running well or is unresponsive, try the following things.

First, try restarting the device: say, "Hey Cortana, restart the device."

If you’re still having problems, press the power button for 4 seconds, until all of the battery indicators fade out. Wait 1 minute, then press the power button again to turn on the device.

If neither of those things works, force restart the device. Hold down the power button for 10 seconds. Release it and wait 30 seconds, then press the power button again to turn on the device.

## Reset or recover your HoloLens

If restarting your HoloLens doesn’t help, another option is to reset it. If resetting it doesn’t fix the problem, the Windows Device Recovery Tool can help you recover your device.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>Resetting or recovering your HoloLens will erase all of your personal data, including apps, games, photos, and settings. You won’t be able to restore a backup once the reset is complete.

## Reset

Resetting your HoloLens keeps the version of the Windows Holographic software that’s installed on it and returns everything else to factory settings.

To reset your HoloLens, go to **Settings** > **Update** > **Reset** and select **Reset device**. The battery will need to have at least a 40 percent charge remaining to reset.

## Recover using the Windows Device Recovery Tool

Before you use this tool, determine if restarting or resetting your HoloLens fixes the problem. The recovery process may take some time, and the latest version of the Windows Holographic software approved for your HoloLens will be installed.

To use the tool, you’ll need a computer running Windows 10 or later, with at least 4 GB of free storage space.  Please note that you can’t run this tool on a virtual machine.
To recover your HoloLens

1. Download and install the [Windows Device Recovery Tool](https://dev.azure.com/ContentIdea/ContentIdea/_queries/query/8a004dbe-73f8-4a32-94bc-368fc2f2a895/) on your computer.
1. Connect the clicker to your computer using the Micro USB cable that came with your HoloLens.
1. Run the Windows Device Recovery Tool and follow the instructions.

If the clicker isn’t automatically detected, select **My device was not detected** and follow the instructions to put your device into recovery mode.
