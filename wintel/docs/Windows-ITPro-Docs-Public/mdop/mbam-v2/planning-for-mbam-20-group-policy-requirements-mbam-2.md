# Planning for MBAM 2.0 Group Policy Requirements


To manage Microsoft BitLocker Administration and Monitoring (MBAM) client computers, you need to consider the types of BitLocker protectors that you want to support in your organization, and then configure the corresponding Group Policy settings that you want to apply. This topic describes the Group Policy settings that are available for use when you are using Microsoft BitLocker Administration and Monitoring to manage BitLocker Drive Encryption in the enterprise.

MBAM supports the following types of BitLocker protectors for operating system drives: Trusted Platform Module (TPM), TPM + PIN, TPM + USB key, and TPM + PIN + USB key, password, numerical password, and Data Recovery Agent. The password protector is supported only for Windows To Go devices and for Windows 8 devices that do not have a TPM. MBAM supports the TPM + USB key and the TPM + PIN + USB key protectors only when the operating system volume is encrypted before MBAM is installed.

MBAM supports the following types of BitLocker protectors for fixed data drives: password, auto-unlock, numerical password, and Data Recovery Agent.

The numeric password protector is applied automatically as part of volume encryption and does not need to be configured.

**Important**  
The default Windows BitLocker drive encryption Group Policy Object (GPO) settings are not used by MBAM and can cause conflicting behavior if they are enabled. To enable MBAM to manage BitLocker, you must define the MBAM Group Policy settings only after installing the MBAM Group Policy template.



Enhanced startup PINs can contain characters, such as uppercase and lowercase letters, and numbers. Unlike BitLocker, MBAM does not support the use of symbols and spaces for enhanced PINs.

Install the MBAM Group Policy template on a computer that is capable of running the Group Policy Management Console (GPMC) or the Advanced Group Policy Management (AGPM) MDOP technology. To edit the GPO settings that enable MBAM functionality, you must first install the MBAM Group Policy template, open the GPMC or AGPM to edit the applicable GPO, and then navigate to the following GPO node: **Computer Configuration**\\**Policies**\\**Administrative Templates**\\**Windows Components**\\**MDOP MBAM (BitLocker Management).**

The MDOP MBAM (BitLocker Management) GPO node contains four global policy settings and four child GPO settings nodes: Client Management, Fixed Drive, Operating System Drive, and Removable Drive. The following sections provide policy definitions and suggested policy settings to assist you in planning for MBAM GPO policy setting requirements.

**Note**  
For more information about configuring the minimum, recommended GPO settings to enable MBAM to manage BitLocker encryption, see [How to Edit MBAM 2.0 GPO Settings](how-to-edit-mbam-20-gpo-settings-mbam-2.md).

<li><p><strong>Select BitLocker recovery information to store</strong>. This policy setting lets you configure the key recovery service to back up BitLocker recovery information. It also lets you configure status reporting service for collecting compliance and audit reports. The policy provides an administrative method of recovering data encrypted by BitLocker to prevent data loss due to the lack of key information. Status report and key recovery activity will automatically and silently be sent to the configured report server location.</p>
<p>If you do not configure or if you disable this policy setting, the Key recovery information will not be saved, and status report and key recovery activity will not be reported to server. When this setting is set to <strong>Recovery Password and key package</strong>, the recovery password and key package will be automatically and silently backed up to the configured key recovery server location.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Enter client checking status frequency in minutes</strong>. This policy setting manages how frequently the client checks the BitLocker protection policies and status on the client computer. This policy also manages how frequently the client compliance status is saved to the server. The client checks the BitLocker protection policies and status on the client computer and also backs up the client recovery key at the configured frequency.</p>
<p>Set this frequency based on the requirement set by your company on how frequently to check the compliance status of the computer, and how frequently to back up the client recovery key.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>MBAM Status reporting service endpoint</strong>. You must configure this setting to enable MBAM Client BitLocker encryption management.

<p>This policy setting lets you manage whether the operating system drive must be encrypted.</p>
<p>For higher security, consider disabling the following policy settings in <strong>System/Power Management/Sleep Settings</strong> when you enable them with TPM + PIN protector:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Allow Standby States (S1-S3) When Sleeping (Plugged In)</p></li>
<li><p>Allow Standby States (S1-S3) When Sleeping (On Battery)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If you are running Microsoft Windows 8 or later, and you want to use BitLocker on a computer without a TPM, select the <strong>Allow BitLocker without a compatible TPM</strong> check box. In this mode, a password is required for startup. If you forget the password, you have to use one of the BitLocker recovery options to access the drive.</p>
<p>On a computer with a compatible TPM, two types of authentication methods can be used at startup to provide added protection for encrypted data. When the computer starts, it can use only the TPM for authentication, or it can also require the entry of a personal identification number (PIN).</p>
<p>If you enable this policy setting, users have to put the operating system drive under BitLocker protection, and the drive will be encrypted.</p>
<p>If you disable this policy, users will not be able to put the operating system drive under BitLocker protection. If you apply this policy after the operating system drive is encrypted, the drive will be decrypted.</p>
