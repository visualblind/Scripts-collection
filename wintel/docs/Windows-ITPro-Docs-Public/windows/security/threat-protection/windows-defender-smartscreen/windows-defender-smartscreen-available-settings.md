# Available Windows Defender SmartScreen Group Policy and mobile device management (MDM) settings
**Applies to:**

- WindowsÂ 10
- Windows 10 Mobile

Windows Defender SmartScreen works with Intune, Group Policy, and mobile device management (MDM) settings to help you manage your organization's computer settings. Based on how you set up Windows Defender SmartScreen, you can show employees a warning page and let them continue to the site, or you can block the site entirely.

See [Windows 10 (and later) settings to protect devices using Intune](https://docs.microsoft.com/intune/endpoint-protection-windows-10#windows-defender-smartscreen-settings) for the controls you can use in Intune.


## Group Policy settings
SmartScreen uses registry-based Administrative Template policy settings. For more info about Group Policy, see the [Group Policy TechCenter](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=214514). This site provides links to the latest technical documentation, videos, and downloads for Group Policy.

## Recommended Group Policy and MDM settings for your organization
By default, Windows Defender SmartScreen lets employees bypass warnings. Unfortunately, this can let employees continue to an unsafe site or to continue to download an unsafe file, even after being warned. Because of this possibility, we strongly recommend that you set up Windows Defender SmartScreen to block high-risk interactions instead of providing just a warning.

To better help you protect your organization, we recommend turning on and using these specific Windows Defender SmartScreen Group Policy and MDM settings.
