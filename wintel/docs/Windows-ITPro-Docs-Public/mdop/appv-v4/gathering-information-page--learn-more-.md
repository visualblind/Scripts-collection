# Gathering Information Page (Learn More)


Use the **Gathering Information** page to review the installation files that could not be located in the directory specified on the **Installation Files** page of this wizard. You must either locate the missing files and then click **Previous** to recreate the Package Accelerator, or select the **Remove these files** check box before you advance to the next page of this wizard.

This page contains the following elements:

<a href="" id="review-missing-files"></a>**Review Missing Files**  
Displays a list of the installation files that were not found in the specified directory.

<a href="" id="remove-these-files"></a>**Remove these files**  
Specifies whether the missing installation files should be removed from the package. Only select this option if the files displayed in the **Review Missing Files** pane are not required to successfully run the application. All files that are removed will not be part of the Package Accelerator and also will not be part of any virtual application packages created by using the Package Accelerator. Ensure that removing these files will not cause the package to fail when running on target computers.
