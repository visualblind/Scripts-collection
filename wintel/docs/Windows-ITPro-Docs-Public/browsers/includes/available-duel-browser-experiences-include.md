## Available dual-browser experiences
Based on the size of your legacy web app dependency, determined by the data collected with [Windows Upgrade Analytics](https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2016/09/26/new-windows-10-and-office-365-features-for-the-secure-productive-enterprise/), there are several options from which you can choose to configure your enterprise browsing environment:

- Use Microsoft Edge as your primary browser.

- Use Microsoft Edge as your primary browser and use Enterprise Mode to open sites in Internet Explorer 11 (IE11) that use IE proprietary technologies.

- Use Microsoft Edge as your primary browser and open all intranet sites in IE11.

- Use IE11 as your primary browser and use Enterprise Mode to open sites in Microsoft Edge that use modern web technologies.

For more info about when to use which option, and which option is best for you, see the [Continuing to make it easier for Enterprise customers to upgrade to Internet Explorer 11 â€” and Windows 10](https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2015/11/23/windows-10-1511-enterprise-improvements) blog.
