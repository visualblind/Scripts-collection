# Configure the security controls in Secure score

**Applies to:**

* [Microsoft Defender Advanced Threat Protection (Microsoft Defender ATP)](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2069559)

> [!NOTE]
> Secure score is now part of [Threat & Vulnerability Management](next-gen-threat-and-vuln-mgt.md) as [Configuration score](configuration-score.md). The secure score page will be available for a few weeks. View the [Secure score](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-atp/overview-secure-score) page.

Each security control lists recommendations that you can take to increase the security posture of your organization.

### Endpoint detection and response (EDR) optimization

A well-configured machine complies to the minimum baseline configuration setting. This tile shows you a list of actions to apply on endpoints to meet the minimum baseline configuration setting for your Endpoint detection and response tool.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This feature is available for machines on Windows 10, version  1607 or later.

#### Minimum baseline configuration setting for EDR

* Microsoft Defender ATP sensor is on
* Data collection is working correctly
* Communication to Microsoft Defender ATP service is not impaired

##### Recommended actions

You can take the following actions to increase the overall security score of your organization:

* Turn on sensor
* Fix sensor data collection
* Fix impaired communications

For more  information, see [Fix unhealthy sensors](fix-unhealthy-sensors.md).

### Windows Defender Antivirus (Windows Defender AV) optimization
A well-configured machine complies to the minimum baseline configuration setting. This tile shows you a list of actions to apply on endpoints to meet the minimum baseline configuration setting for Windows Defender AV.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This feature is available for machines on Windows 10, version  1607 or later.

#### Minimum baseline configuration setting for Windows Defender AV:
A well-configured machine for Windows Defender AV meets the following requirements:

- Windows Defender AV is reporting correctly
- Windows Defender AV is turned on
- Security intelligence is up-to-date
- Real-time protection is on
- Potentially Unwanted Application (PUA) protection is enabled

You can take the following actions to increase the overall security score of your organization:

>[!NOTE]
> For the Windows Defender Antivirus properties to show,  you'll need to ensure that the Windows Defender Antivirus Cloud-based protection is properly configured on the machine. 

- Fix antivirus reporting
  - This recommendation is displayed when the Windows Defender Antivirus is not properly configured to report its health state. For more information on fixing the reporting, see [Configure and validate network connections](../windows-defender-antivirus/configure-network-connections-windows-defender-antivirus.md).
- Turn on antivirus
- Update antivirus Security intelligence 
- Turn on real-time protection
- Turn on PUA protection

For more information, see [Configure Windows Defender Antivirus](../windows-defender-antivirus/configure-windows-defender-antivirus-features.md).

### OS security updates optimization

This tile shows you the number of machines that require the latest security updates. It also shows machines that are running on the latest Windows Insider preview build and serves as a reminder to ensure that users should run the latest builds.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This feature is available for machines on Windows 10, version  1607 or later.

You can take the following actions to increase the overall security score of your organization:

* Install the latest security updates
* Fix sensor data collection
  * The Microsoft Defender ATP service relies on sensor data collection to determine the security state of a machine. The service will not be able to determine the security state of machines that are not reporting sensor data properly. It's important to ensure that sensor data collection is working properly. For more information, see [Fix unhealthy sensors](fix-unhealthy-sensors.md).
