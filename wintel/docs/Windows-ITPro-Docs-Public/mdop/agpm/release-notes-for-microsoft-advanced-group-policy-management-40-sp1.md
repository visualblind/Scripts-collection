## AGPM 4.0 SP1 known issues


This section contains release notes for AGPM 4.0 SP1.

### <a href="" id="control-panel-s--uninstall--tool-may-not-work-when-you-try-to-change-agpm-server-settings"></a>Control Panel’s “Uninstall” tool may not work when you try to change AGPM Server settings

The tool in Control Panel that lets you uninstall or change a program may not work when you try to change AGPM server settings.

WORKAROUND: Before you try to change AGPM server settings by using Control Panel, make a copy of the AGPM Archive folder. You can then use Setup.exe to reinstall the AGPM server and choose the configuration parameters that you want.

### Reports do not display the links that were added to a Group Policy Object

The AGPM settings and difference reports do not display the links that were added to a Group Policy Object (GPO).

WORKAROUND: To view the links in the reports, select the GPO in the Group Policy Management Console (GPMC), and click the **Settings** tab in the right pane.

### <a href="" id="reports-do-not-display-all--choice-options-properties--settings"></a>Reports do not display all “Choice Options Properties” settings

The AGPM settings and difference reports do not display all of the settings that were selected on the Choice Options Properties window in the Group Policy Object Editor.

WORKAROUND: Use the GPMC to view the selected Choice Options Properties settings in the reports.

### Reports do not display the Show and Hide tabs in certain browsers

The Show and Hide tabs, shown on the right side of the AGPM settings and difference reports, are not displayed when you view the reports in Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox.

WORKAROUND: View the reports by using Internet Explorer.

### AGPM settings and difference reports may show different content from GPMC reports

The AGPM settings and difference reports may not show the same content as reports in the Group Policy Management Console (GPMC).

WORKAROUND: Use the GPMC to view the AGPM reports.

### AGPM Service does not start if the domain controller is not online

When the AGPM Service is installed on a domain controller on Windows 8, the Service does not start if the domain controller is not online.

WORKAROUND: Manually start the AGPM Service after the domain controller is online.

### Upgrade of AGPM Server to AGPM 4.0 SP1 is blocked when you upgrade from the AGPM 4.0 release plus the hotfix

If you try to upgrade the AGPM server to AGPM 4.0. SP1 after installing AGPM 4.0 and then installing the AGPM hotfix (see Knowledge Base article [2643502](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=254474)), the upgrade fails and cannot be completed.

WORKAROUND: Uninstall the AGPM 4.0 Server and then install AGPM 4.0 SP1.

### Reports do not display organizational unit links

If you link an uncontrolled GPO to an organizational unit and then control that GPO using AGPM, the AGPM settings and difference reports do not display the organizational unit links.

WORKAROUND: From the **Controlled** tab of the **Change Settings** node, right-click the GPO and click **Settings** and then click **GPO Links** to view the organizational links. Alternatively, you can use the GPMC to view the links to a GPO from the **Scope** tab.
