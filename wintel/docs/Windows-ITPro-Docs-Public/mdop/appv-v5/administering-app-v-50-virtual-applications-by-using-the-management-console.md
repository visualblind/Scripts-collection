# Administering App-V 5.0 Virtual Applications by Using the Management Console


Use the Microsoft Application Virtualization (App-V) 5.0 management server to manage packages, connection groups, and package access in your environment. The server publishes application icons, shortcuts, and file type associations to authorized computers that run the App-V 5.0 client. One or more management servers typically share a common data store for configuration and package information.

The management server uses Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) groups to manage user authorization and has SQL Server installed to manage the database and data store.

Because the management servers stream applications to end users on demand, these servers are ideally suited for system configurations that have reliable, high-bandwidth LANs. The management server consists of the following components:

-   Management Server – Use the management server to manage packages and connection groups.

-   Publishing Server – Use the publishing server to deploy packages to computers that run the App-V 5.0 client.

-   Management Database - Use the management database to manage the package access and to publish the server’s synchronization with the management server.
