# How to Upload a MED-V Image to the Server


After a MED-V image has been tested, it can be packed and then uploaded to the server. For information on configuring an image Web distribution server, see [How to Configure the Image Web Distribution Server](how-to-configure-the-image-web-distribution-server.md).

Once a MED-V image is packed and uploaded to the server, it can be distributed to users by using an enterprise software distribution center, or it can be downloaded by users using a deployment package. For information on deployment using an enterprise software distribution center, see [Deploying a MED-V Workspace Using an Enterprise Software Distribution System](deploying-a-med-v-workspace-using-an-enterprise-software-distribution-system.md). For information on deployment using a package, see [Deploying a MED-V Workspace Using a Deployment Package](deploying-a-med-v-workspace-using-a-deployment-package.md).

**Note**  
Before uploading an image, verify that a Web proxy is not defined in your browser settings and that Windows Update is not currently running.



**To upload a MED-V image to the server**

1.  In the **Local Packed Images** pane, select the image you created.

2.  Click **Upload**.

    The image is uploaded to the server. This might take a considerable amount of time.

    Images on the server are defined with the properties listed in the following table.
