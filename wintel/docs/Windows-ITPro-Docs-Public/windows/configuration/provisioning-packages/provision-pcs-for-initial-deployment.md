# Provision PCs with common settings for initial deployment (desktop wizard)


**Applies to**

-   Windows 10

This topic explains how to create and apply a provisioning package that contains common enterprise settings to a device running all desktop editions of Windows 10 except Windows 10 Home.

You can apply a provisioning package on a USB drive to off-the-shelf devices during setup, making it fast and easy to configure new devices. 

## Advantages
-   You can configure new devices without reimaging.

-   Works on both mobile and desktop devices.

-   No network connectivity required.

-   Simple to apply.

## What does the desktop wizard do?

The desktop wizard helps you configure the following settings in a provisioning package:

- Set device name
- Upgrade product edition
- Configure the device for shared use
- Remove pre-installed software
- Configure Wi-Fi network 
- Enroll device in Active Directory or Azure Active Directory 
- Create local administrator account 
- Add applications and certificates

>[!WARNING]
>You must run Windows Configuration Designer on Windows 10 to configure Azure Active Directory enrollment using any of the wizards.

Provisioning packages can include management instructions and policies, installation of specific apps, customization of network connections and policies, and more. 

> [!TIP]
> Use the desktop wizard to create a package with the common settings, then switch to the advanced editor to add other settings, apps, policies, etc.

## Create the provisioning package

Use the Windows Configuration Designer tool to create a provisioning package. [Learn how to install Windows Configuration Designer.](provisioning-install-icd.md)

1. Open Windows Configuration Designer (by default, %windir%\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\Assessment and Deployment Kit\Imaging and Configuration Designer\x86\ICD.exe).

2. Click **Provision desktop devices**.

3. Name your project and click **Finish**. The pages for desktop provisioning will walk you through the following steps.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When you build a provisioning package, you may include sensitive information in the project files and in the provisioning package (.ppkg) file. Although you have the option to encrypt the .ppkg file, project files are not encrypted. You should store the project files in a secure location and delete the project files when they are no longer needed.
