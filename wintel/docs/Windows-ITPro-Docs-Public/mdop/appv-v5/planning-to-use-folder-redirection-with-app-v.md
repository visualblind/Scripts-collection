# Planning to Use Folder Redirection with App-V


App-V 5.0 SP2 supports the use of folder redirection, a feature that enables users and administrators to redirect the path of a folder to a new location.

This topic contains the following sections:

-   [Requirements for using folder redirection](#bkmk-folder-redir-reqs)

-   [How to configure folder redirection for use with App-V](#bkmk-folder-redir-cfg)

-   [How folder redirection works with App-V](#bkmk-folder-redir-works)

-   [Overview of folder redirection](#bkmk-folder-redir-overview)

## <a href="" id="bkmk-folder-redir-cfg"></a>How to configure folder redirection for use with App-V


Folder redirection can be applied to different folders, such as Desktop, My Documents, My Pictures, etc. However, the only folder that impacts the use of App-V applications is the user’s roaming AppData folder (%AppData%). You can apply folder redirection to any other supported folders without impacting App-V.

## <a href="" id="bkmk-folder-redir-works"></a>How folder redirection works with App-V


The following table describes how folder redirection works when %AppData% is redirected to a network and when you have met the requirements listed earlier in this article.

<table>

</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th align="left">Virtual environment state</th>
<th align="left">Action that occurs</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="left"><p>When the virtual environment starts</p></td>
<td align="left"><p>The virtual file system (VFS) AppData folder is mapped to the local AppData folder (%LocalAppData%) instead of to the user’s roaming AppData folder (%AppData%).</p>
<ul>
<li><p>LocalAppData contains a local cache of the user’s roaming AppData folder for the package in use. The local cache is located under:</p>
<p><code>%LocalAppData%\Microsoft\AppV\Client\VFS\PackageGUID\AppData</code></p></li>
<li><p>The latest data from the user’s roaming AppData folder is copied to and replaces the data currently in the local cache.</p></li>
<li><p>While the virtual environment is running, data continues to be saved to the local cache. Data is served only out of %LocalAppData% and is not moved or synchronized with %AppData% until the end user shuts down the computer.</p></li>
<li><p>Entries to the AppData folder are made using the user context, not the system context.</p></li>
</ul>
<div class="alert">
<strong>Note</strong><br/><p>The App-V client folder redirection sometimes fails to move files from %AppData% to %LocalAppData%.

</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td align="left"><p>When the virtual environment shuts down</p></td>
<td align="left"><p>The local cached data in AppData (roaming) is zipped up and copied to the “real” roaming AppData folder in %AppData%. A time stamp, which indicates the last known upload, is simultaneously saved as a registry key under:</p>
<p><code>HKCU\Software\Microsoft\AppV\Client\Packages&amp;lt;PACKAGE_GUID&gt;\AppDataTime</code></p>
<p>To provide redundancy, App-V 5.0 keeps the three most recent copies of the compressed data under %AppData%.</p></td>
