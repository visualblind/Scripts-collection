<a href="" id="--vendor-msft-sharedpc"></a>**./Vendor/MSFT/SharedPC**  
The root node for the SharedPC configuration service provider.

The supported operation is Get.

<a href="" id="enablesharedpcmode"></a>**EnableSharedPCMode**  
A boolean value that specifies whether Shared PC mode is enabled.

The supported operations are Add, Get, Replace, and Delete.

Setting this value to True triggers the action to configure a device to Shared PC mode.

The default value changed to false in Windows 10, version 1703. The default value is Not Configured and this node needs to be configured independent of EnableSharedPCMode. In Windows 10, version 1607, the value is set to True and the education environment is automatically configured when SharedPC mode is configured.

<a href="" id="setpowerpolicies"></a>**SetPowerPolicies**  
Optional. A boolean value that specifies that the power policies should be set when configuring SharedPC mode.

> [!NOTE]

The supported operations are Add, Get, Replace, and Delete.

The default value is Not Configured and the effective power settings are determined by the OS's default power settings. Its value in the SharedPC provisioning package is True.

<a href="" id="maintenancestarttime"></a>**MaintenanceStartTime**  
Optional. An integer value that specifies the daily start time of maintenance hour. Given in minutes from midnight. The range is 0-1440.

> [!NOTE]
>  If used, this value must be set before the action on the **EnableSharedPCMode** node is taken.

The default value is Not Configured and its value in the SharedPC provisioning package is 0 (12 AM).

<a href="" id="signinonresume"></a>**SignInOnResume**  
Optional. A boolean value that, when set to True, requires sign in whenever the device wakes up from sleep mode.

> [!NOTE]
> If used, this value must be set before the action on the **EnableSharedPCMode** node is taken.

The supported operations are Add, Get, Replace, and Delete.

The default value is Not Configured and its value in the SharedPC provisioning package is True.

<a href="" id="sleeptimeout"></a>**SleepTimeout**  
The amount of time in seconds before the PC sleeps. 0 means the PC never sleeps. Default is 5 minutes. This node is optional. 

> [!NOTE]
> If used, this value must be set before the action on the **EnableSharedPCMode** node is taken.

The supported operations are Add, Get, Replace, and Delete.

The default value is Not Configured, and effective behavior is determined by the OS's default settings. Its value in the SharedPC provisioning package for Windows 10, version 1703 is 300, and in Windows 10, version 1607 is 3600.

<a href="" id="enableaccountmanager"></a>**EnableAccountManager**  
A boolean that enables the account manager for shared PC mode.

> [!NOTE]
> If used, this value must be set before the action on the **EnableSharedPCMode** node is taken.

<a href="" id="accountmodel"></a>**AccountModel**  
Configures which type of accounts are allowed to use the PC.

<a href="" id="deletionpolicy"></a>**DeletionPolicy**  
Configures when accounts are deleted.

> [!NOTE]
> If used, this value must be set before the action on the **EnableSharedPCMode** node is taken.

The supported operations are Add, Get, Replace, and Delete.

For Windows 10, version 1607, here is the list shows the supported values:

-   0 - Delete immediately.
-   1 (default) - Delete at disk space threshold.

For Windows 10, version 1703, here is the list of supported values:  

- 0 - Delete immediately
- 1 - Delete at disk space threshold
- 2 - Delete at disk space threshold and inactive threshold

The default value is Not Configured. Its value in the SharedPC provisioning package is 1 or 2.

<a href="" id="diskleveldeletion"></a>**DiskLevelDeletion**  
Sets the percentage of disk space remaining on a PC before cached accounts will be deleted to free disk space. Accounts that have been inactive the longest will be deleted first.

The default value is Not Configured. Its default value in the SharedPC provisioning package is 25.

For example, if the **DiskLevelCaching** number is set to 50 and the **DiskLevelDeletion** number is set to 25 (both default values). Accounts will be cached while the free disk space is above 25%. When the free disk space is less than 25% (the deletion number) during a daily maintenance period, accounts will be deleted (oldest last used first) when the system is idle until the free disk space is above 50% (the caching number). Accounts will be deleted immediately at sign off of an account if free space is under half of the deletion threshold and disk space is very low, regardless of whether the PC is actively in use or not.

The supported operations are Add, Get, Replace, and Delete.

<a href="" id="disklevelcaching"></a>**DiskLevelCaching**  
Sets the percentage of available disk space a PC should have before it stops deleting cached accounts.

When the free disk space is less than 25% (the deletion number) during a maintenance period, accounts will be deleted (oldest last used first) until the free disk space is above 50% (the caching number).
