Quick install:
-------------

AppServ can be obtained from http://www.appservnetwork.com
AppServ is a complete package of Apache, MySQL and PHP and includes
everything required by IPplan to run on a Windows platform. If you use
AppServ, you do not need ODBC.

The latest version of AppServ tested was 2.4.2 - AppServ had some issues
with IPplan. Wampserver was tested too and IPplan had no issues with
Wampserver (see http://www.wampserver.com/en/index.php) - version 1.3.2
was used. Wampserver works very similar to AppServ - just change the
directories below accordingly.

If you want to view or edit any of the files under Windows, use WordPad,
not NotePad as NotePad does not understand Unix files.

NOTE: if upgrading, read the UPGRADE file.
NOTE2: if you get a fatal error about an undefined database function, read
       the FAQ section in the README

I assume a working installation of MySQL 3.23.15 or higher and php 4.1 
using AppServ. 
To get multilingual support (languages other than English), you will 
need to follow the steps later in this document.

In your web tree (normally c:\appserv\www), 

1) create a directory called ipplan
2) untar tar-ball into this directory (WinZIP can handle tar files)
3) create the database and tables by issuing the following at the
   DOS command prompt for the default MyISAM table type:

[NOTE: You may need to modify c:\windows\my.ini and comment out the line
 under the [client] section called default-character-set with a #
 as this caused an error when running mysqladmin on my machine]

[NOTE: user is the master user you created when you installed AppServ]

   \appserv\mysql\bin\mysqladmin -p -u user create ipplan

   ONLY DO THIS STEP ONCE FOR A NEW INSTALLATION
4) add a database user for ipplan using \appserv\mysql\bin\mysql -p
   GRANT SELECT,INSERT,UPDATE,DELETE on ipplan.* 
       TO ipplan@localhost IDENTIFIED by 'password';

   Change the above password to whatever you wish

   ONLY DO THIS STEP ONCE FOR A NEW INSTALLATION

   NOTE: The default installation of AppServ does not have secure
   database permissions for default MySQL users. Make sure you fix
   this in your install as anybody can access your system.

   NOTE: You may get errors about password compatibility with later
   versions of AppServ when running the IPplan install script. If you
   do, you may need to issue the following on a MySQL prompt:

      set password for 'ipplan'@'localhost' = old_password('password');

   Replace password with the password you want to use for your database

5) modify the user and password info in the config.php script.
   additional settings can be changed in the config.php script at this
   stage too. See the README for more information.

   if you are using InnoDB transaction safe tables, make sure to enable 
   transaction support in config.php

6) open a web browser and point it to the installation script in the
   admin directory (http://mywebserver.com/ipplan/admin/install.php)

   you will be prompted to create the database schema. The user created
   above does not have enough rights to create tables so you will need
   to either copy the statements into the database, or temporarily change
   the database password in the config.php file to a database user that has
   enough rights to do this.

   you can manually load the statements by copying the display output
   from the install.php script into a file (example ipplandbf.sql)
   and then executing the file by logining in as the newly created user using
   mysql and issue:

   \appserv\mysql\bin\mysql -p -u user ipplan < ipplandbf.sql

7) now point your web browser to the main IPplan web page
   (http://mywebserver.com/ipplan), select the admin drop down menu and add 
   customers, groups and users using the admin user defined in the config.php
   file - you MUST create at least one regular user, one group and one customer

8) send me an e-mail about how you use IPplan!

If you have any problems, you can look in the \\apserv\apache\logs directory

Enabling multilingual support:
-----------------------------

From the php manual

Note to Win32 Users:  In order to enable this module on a Windows environment, 
you must copy gnu_gettext.dll from the DLL folder of the PHP/Win32 binary 
package to the SYSTEM32 folder of your windows machine. (Ex: C:\WINNT\SYSTEM32  or C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM32). Starting with PHP 4.2.3 the name changed to 
libintl-1.dll, this requires also iconv.dll to be copied.

To do this, follow the instructions for installing php from http://www.php.net.

 To check if gettext is enabled in php, execute this simple php script:

<?php
phpinfo();
?>

If your language is not currently available, feel free to follow the 
instructions in the TRANSLATIONS file and do your own.

Hope it works!
