# Windows 10, version 1903 basic level Windows diagnostic events and fields

 **Applies to**

- Windows 10, version 1903


The Basic level gathers a limited set of information that is critical for understanding the device and its configuration including: basic device information, quality-related information, app compatibility, and Microsoft Store. When the level is set to Basic, it also includes the Security level information.

The Basic level helps to identify problems that can occur on a particular device hardware or software configuration. For example, it can help determine if crashes are more frequent on devices with a specific amount of memory or that are running a particular driver version. This helps Microsoft fix operating system or app problems.

Use this article to learn about diagnostic events, grouped by event area, and the fields within each event. A brief description is provided for each field. Every event generated includes common data, which collects device data.

AppCrash is emitted once for each crash handled by WER (e.g. from an unhandled exception or FailFast or ReportException). Note that Generic Watson event types (e.g. from PLM) that may be considered crashes\" by a user DO NOT emit this event.

The following fields are available:

## Hang Reporting events

### Microsoft.Windows.HangReporting.AppHangEvent

AppHang is reported only on PC devices. It handles classic Win32 hangs and is emitted only once per report.
