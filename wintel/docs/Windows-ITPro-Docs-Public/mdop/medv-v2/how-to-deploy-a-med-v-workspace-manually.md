# How to Deploy a MED-V Workspace Manually


In some instances, you might want to deploy your MED-V workspace manually, for example, if your company does not use an electronic software distribution system to deploy applications.

This section provides instruction about how to manually deploy a MED-V workspace.

**To deploy a MED-V workspace manually**

1.  Copy all prerequisite applications and the MED-V workspace package files to a shared drive or to a DVD. The following is a list of the required applications and files.

    -   **Windows Virtual PC**. For more information, see [Configure Installation Prerequisites](configure-installation-prerequisites.md).

    -   **Windows Virtual PC Additions and Updates**. For more information, see [Configure Installation Prerequisites](configure-installation-prerequisites.md).

    -   **MED-V Host Agent Installation File** – installs the Host Agent (MED-V\_HostAgent\_Setup installation file).

        **Warning**  
        Close Internet Explorer before you install the MED-V Host Agent, otherwise conflicts can occur later with URL redirection. You can also do this by specifying a computer restart during a distribution.



~~~
-   **MED-V Workspace Installer, VHD, and Setup Executable** – created with the **MED-V Workspace Packager**. For more information, see [Create a MED-V Workspace Package](create-a-med-v-workspace-package.md).

    **Important**  
    The compressed VHD file (.medv) and the Setup executable program (setup.exe) must be in the same folder as the MED-V workspace installer.
~~~



2. Install the following in the order listed. The end user can perform this task manually or you can create a script to install the following:

   -   Windows Virtual PC and the Windows Virtual PC additions and updates. A computer restart is required.

   -   The MED-V Host Agent.

       **Note**  
       If it is running, Internet Explorer must be restarted before the installation of the MED-V Host Agent can finish.



~~~
-   The MED-V workspace package.

    Install the MED-V workspace by running the setup.exe program that is included in the MED-V workspace package files.
~~~

3. Complete first time setup.

   After the MED-V workspace is installed, you have the option of starting MED-V. This starts the MED-V Host Agent. You can either start MED-V at that time, or start the MED-V Host Agent later to complete first time setup.

   To start the MED-V Host Agent, click **Start**, click **All Programs**, click **Microsoft Enterprise Desktop Virtualization**, and then click **MED-V Host Agent**.
