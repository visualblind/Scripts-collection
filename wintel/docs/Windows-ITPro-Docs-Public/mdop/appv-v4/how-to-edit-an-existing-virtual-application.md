# How to Edit an Existing Virtual Application


You can use the following procedure to edit the properties associated with an existing virtual application package by using the Application Virtualization (App-V) Sequencer. You must open the existing virtual application, make the necessary updates, and then save the updated virtual application package.

**To modify an existing virtual application**

1.  To start the App-V Sequencer Console, on the computer running the App-V Sequencer, select **Start**/**Programs**/**Microsoft Application Virtualization**/**Microsoft Application Virtualization Sequencer**.

2.  To open the existing virtual application, in the App-V Console, select **File**/**Open**. Use the **Open** dialog box to locate the associated SPRJ file you want to modify.

3.  Modify the virtual application package. For more information about what properties can be modified, see [How to Determine Whether to Edit or Upgrade a Virtual Application Package](how-to-determine-whether-to-edit-or-upgrade-a-virtual-application-package.md).

4.  To save the modifications, select **File** / **Save**.
