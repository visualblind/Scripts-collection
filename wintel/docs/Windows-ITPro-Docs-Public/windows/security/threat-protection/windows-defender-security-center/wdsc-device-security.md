# Device security

**Applies to**

- Windows 10, version 1803 and later

The **Device security** section contains information and settings for built-in device security.

You can choose to hide the section from users of the machine. This can be useful if you don't want employees in your organization to see or have access to user-configured options for the features shown in the section.

## Hide the Device security section

You can choose to hide the entire section by using Group Policy. The section will not appear on the home page of the Windows Security app, and its icon will not be shown on the navigiation bar on the side of the app.

This can only be done in Group Policy.

1.  On your Group Policy management machine, open the [Group Policy Management Console](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/cc731212.aspx), right-click the Group Policy Object you want to configure and click **Edit**.

2.  In the **Group Policy Management Editor** go to **Computer configuration** and click **Administrative templates**.

3.  Expand the tree to **Windows components > Windows Security > Device security**.

4.  Open the **Hide the Device security area** setting and set it to **Enabled**. Click **OK**.

5. [Deploy the updated GPO as you normally do](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ee663280(v=vs.85).aspx).
