# About DaRT 10


DaRT 10 includes the following enhancements and changes as described in this topic.

## <a href="" id="what-s-new"></a>What’s new


-   **Support for Windows 10**

    You can create DaRT images by using Windows 10.

    **Note**  
    For earlier versions of the Windows operating systems, continue to use the earlier versions of DaRT.

     

-   **Windows Defender**

    Windows Defender is now part of the Windows 10 Preinstallation Environment (PE) image. As a result, Windows Defender has been removed from the DaRT 10 toolset.

## Requirements


-   **Windows Assessment and Development Kit 10.0**

    Windows Assessment and Development Kit (ADK) 10.0 is a required prerequisite for the DaRT Recovery Image Wizard. Windows ADK 10.0 contains deployment tools that are used to customize, deploy, and service Windows images. It also contains the Windows Preinstallation Environment (Windows PE).

    **Note**  
    Windows ADK 10.0 is not required if you are installing only Remote Connection Viewer or Crash Analyzer.

     

-   **Windows 10 Debugging Tools**

    To use the Crash Analyzer tool in DaRT 10, you need the required debugging tools, which are available in the Software Development Kit for Windows 10.
