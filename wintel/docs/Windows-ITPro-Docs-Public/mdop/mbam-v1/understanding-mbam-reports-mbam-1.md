# Understanding MBAM Reports


Microsoft BitLocker Administration and Monitoring (MBAM) generates various reports to monitor BitLocker usage and compliance. This topic describes the MBAM reports for enterprise compliance, individual computers, hardware compatibility, and key recovery activity.

## Understanding Reports


To access the Reports feature of MBAM, open the MBAM administration website. Select **Reports** in the navigation pane. Then, in the main content pane, click the tab for your report type: **Enterprise Compliance Report**, **Computer Compliance Report**, **Hardware Audit Report**, or **Recovery Audit Report**.

### Enterprise Compliance Report

An Enterprise Compliance Report provides information on overall BitLocker compliance in your organization. The available filters for this report allow you to narrow your search results according to Compliance state and Error status. This report runs every six hours.

If the encryption state indicates that the computer is not encrypted, encryption might still be in process, or there might be an error on the computer.

If the state has not changed, there may be an error for this computer or hardware type.</p></td>

### Computer Compliance Report

The Computer Compliance Report displays information that is specific to a computer or user.

The Computer Compliance Report provides detailed encryption information and applicable policies for each drive on a computer, including operating system drives and fixed data drives. To view this report type, click the computer name in the Enterprise Compliance Report or type the computer name in the Computer Compliance Report. To view the details of each drive, expand the Computer Name entry.

**Note**  
This report does not provide encryption status for Removable Data Volumes.

### Hardware Audit Report

This report can help you audit changes to the Hardware Compatibility status of specific computer makes and models. To help you narrow your search results, this report includes filtering on criteria such as type of change and time of occurrence. Each state change is tracked by user and date and time. The Hardware Type is automatically populated by the MBAM agent that runs on the client computer. This report tracks user changes to the information collected directly from the MBAM managed computer. A typical administrative change is changing from Compatible to incompatible. However, the administrator can also revise any field.

### Recovery Audit Report

The Recovery Audit Report can help you audit users who have requested access to recovery keys. The filter criteria for this report includes type of user making the request, type of key requested, time of occurrence, success or fail, time of occurrence, and type of user requesting (help desk, end user). This report enables administrators to produce contextual reports based on need.

</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td align="left"><p>Reason Description</p></td>
