# Start and Stop the AGPM Service


The AGPM Service is a Windows service that acts as a security proxy, managing client access to Group Policy Objects (GPOs) in the archive and production environment.

**Important**  
Stopping or disabling the AGPM Service will prevent AGPM Clients from performing any operations (such as listing or editing GPOs) through the server.

 

A user account with access to the AGPM Server (the computer on which the AGPM Service is installed) is required to complete this procedure.

**To start or stop the AGPM Service**

1.  On the computer on which Microsoft Advanced Group Policy Management - Server (and therefore the AGPM Service) is installed, click **Start**, click **Control Panel**, click **Administrative Tools**, and then click **Services**.

2.  In the list of services, right-click **AGPM Service** and select **Start**, **Restart**, or **Stop**.

    **Caution**  
    Do not modify settings for the AGPM Service through **Administrative Tools** and **Services** in the operating system. Doing so can prevent the AGPM Service from starting.
