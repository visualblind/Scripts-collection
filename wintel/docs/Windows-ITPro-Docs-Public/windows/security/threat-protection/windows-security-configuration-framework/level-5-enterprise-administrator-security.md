# Level 5 enterprise administrator workstation security configuration

**Applies to**  

-   Windows 10


Administrators (particularly of identity or security systems) present the highest risk to the organizationâˆ’through data theft, data alteration, or service disruption. 
A level 5 configuration should include all the configurations from levels 4, 3, 2, and 1 and adds additional controls. We are planning recommendations for the additional controls now, so check back soon for level 5 enterprise administrator security configuration guidance!
