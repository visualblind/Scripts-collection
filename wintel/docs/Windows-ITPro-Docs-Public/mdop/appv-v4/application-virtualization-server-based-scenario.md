# Application Virtualization Server-Based Scenario


If you plan to use a server-based deployment scenario for your Microsoft Application Virtualization (App-V) environment, you should understand the differences between the Application Virtualization Management Server and the Application Virtualization Streaming Server. The topics in this section describe those differences and also provide information about package delivery methods, transmission protocols, and external components that you have to consider as you continue with your deployment. This section also provides step-by-step procedures for installing and configuring the App-V Management Server and the Application Virtualization Streaming Servers.
