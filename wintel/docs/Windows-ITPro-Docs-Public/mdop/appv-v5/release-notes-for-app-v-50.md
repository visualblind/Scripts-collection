## Known Issues with App-V 5.0


This section contains release notes about the known issues with App-V 5.0.

### Unable to terminate adding packages when using server PowerShell cmdlets

When you add a package using PowerShell, there is no method to exit adding new packages.

WORKAROUND: To stop adding packages, press **enter** after you have added the final package.

### <a href="" id="-------------app-v-5-0-client-rejects-packages-from-servers-whose-ssl-certificate-has-been-revoked"></a> App-V 5.0 client rejects packages from servers whose SSL certificate has been revoked

When using the HTTPS protocol, the App-V 5.0 client will by default reject packages from servers whose SSL certificate has been revoked. This behavior can be turned off through configuration by modifying the **VerifyCertificateRevocationList** setting. Applying new configuration for this setting will not take effect until the App-V 5.0 service is restarted.

WORKAROUND: Restart the App-V 5.0 service.
