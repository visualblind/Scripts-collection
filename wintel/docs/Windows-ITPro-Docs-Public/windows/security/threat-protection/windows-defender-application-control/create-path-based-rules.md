Beginning with Windows 10 version 1903, Windows Defender Application Control (WDAC) policies can contain path-based rules.

- New-CIPolicy parameters
  - FilePath: create path rules under path \<path to scan> for anything not user-writeable (at the individual file level)

    ```powershell
    New-CIPolicy -f .\mypolicy.xml -l FilePath -s <path to scan> -u
    ```

    Optionally, add -UserWriteablePaths to ignore user writeability

  - FilePathRule: create a rule where filepath string is directly set to value of \<any path string>

    ```powershell
    New-CIPolicyRule -FilePathRule <any path string>
    ```

    Useful for wildcards like C:\foo\\*

- Usage follows the same flow as per-app rules:

  ```powershell
  $rules = New-CIPolicyRule …
  $rules += New-CIPolicyRule …
  …
  New-CIPolicyRule -f .\mypolicy.xml -u
  ```

- Wildcards supported
  - Suffix (ex. C:\foo\\*) OR Prefix (ex. *\foo\bar.exe)
    - One or the other, not both at the same time
    - Does not support wildcard in the middle (ex. C:\\*\foo.exe)
- Supported Macros:
  - %WINDIR%\\...
  - %SYSTEM32%\\...
  - %OSDRIVE%\\...

- Disable default FilePath rule protection of enforcing user-writeability. For example, to add “Disabled:Runtime FilePath Rule Protection” to the policy:

  ```powershell
  Set-RuleOption -o 18 .\policy.xml
  ```
