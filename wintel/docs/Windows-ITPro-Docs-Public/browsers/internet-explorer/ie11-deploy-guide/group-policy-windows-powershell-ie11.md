# Group Policy, Windows Powershell, and Internet Explorer 11
Your domain-joined Group Policy Objects (GPOs) can use any of Group Policy-related “cmdlets” that run within Windows PowerShell.

Each cmdlet is a single-function command-line tool that can:

-   Create, edit, remove, back up, and import GPOs.

-   Create, update, and remove Group Policy links.

-   Set inheritance flags and permissions on organizational units (OU) and domains.

-   Configure registry-based policy settings and registry settings for Group Policy preferences.

For more info about PowerShell and Group Policy management, see [Use Windows PowerShell to Manage Group Policy](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=276828).
