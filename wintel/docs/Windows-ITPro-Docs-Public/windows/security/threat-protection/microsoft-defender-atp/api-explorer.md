# API Explorer
**Applies to:**
- [Microsoft Defender Advanced Threat Protection (Windows Defender ATP)](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2069559)

[!include[Prerelease information](prerelease.md)]

The Microsoft Defender ATP API Explorer is a tool that helps you explore various Microsoft Defender ATP APIs interactively. 

The API Explorer makes it easy to construct and perform API queries, test and send requests for any available Microsoft Defender ATP API endpoint. You can also use the API Explorer to perform actions or find data that might not yet be available through the user interface.

The tool is useful during app development because it allows you to perform API queries that respect your user access settings, reducing the need to generate access tokens. 

You can also use the tool to explore the gallery of sample queries, copy result code samples, and generate debug information.

With the API Explorer, you can:

- Run requests for any method and see responses in real-time
- Quickly browse through the API samples and learn what parameters they support
- Make API calls with ease; no need to authenticate beyond the management portal sign-in

## Access API Explorer
From the left navigation menu, select **Partners & APIs** > **API Explorer**.

## Supported APIs 
API Explorer supports all the APIs offered by Microsoft Defender ATP.
  
The list of supported APIs is available in the [APIs documentation](apis-intro.md). 

## Get started with the API Explorer
1. In the left pane, there is a list of sample requests that you can use. 
2. Follow the links and click **Run query**. 

Some of the samples may require specifying a parameter in the URL, for example, {machine- id}.

## FAQ
**Do I need to have an API token to use the API Explorer?** <br>
Credentials to access an API are not needed since the API Explorer uses the Microsoft Defender ATP management portal token whenever it makes a request.

The logged-in user authentication credential is used to verify that the API Explorer is authorized to access data on your behalf.

Specific API requests are limited based on your RBAC privileges; for example, a request to "Submit indicator" is limited to the security admin role.
