# TakeATest (Windows Configuration Designer reference)

Use TakeATest to configure the Take A Test app, a secure browser for test-taking. Many schools use online testing for formative and summative assessments. It's critical that students use a secure browser that prevents them from using other computer or Internet resources during the test. For more information, see [Take tests in Windows 10](https://docs.microsoft.com/education/windows/take-tests-in-windows-10).
