# How to Repair an Application


To repair a selected application, you can perform the following procedure directly from the **Results** pane of the **Application** node in the Application Virtualization Client Management Console. When you repair an application, you remove any custom user settings and restore the default settings. This action does not change or delete shortcuts or file type associations, and it does not remove the application from cache.

**To repair an application**

1.  Move the cursor to the **Results** pane.

2.  Right-click the desired application, and select **Repair** from the pop-up menu.

3.  At the confirmation prompt, click **Yes** to repair the application or **No** to cancel.
