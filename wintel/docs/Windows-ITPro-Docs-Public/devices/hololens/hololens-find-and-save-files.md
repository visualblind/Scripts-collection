Files you create on HoloLens, including Office documents, photos, and videos, are saved to your HoloLens. To view and manage them, you can use the File Explorer app on HoloLens or File Explorer on your PC. To sync photos and other files to the cloud, use the OneDrive app on HoloLens.

## View files on HoloLens

Use File Explorer on HoloLens to view and manage files on your device, including 3D objects, documents, and pictures. Go to Start  > All apps  > File Explorer  on HoloLens to get started.

>[!TIP]
>If there are no files listed in File Explorer, select **This Device** in the top left pane.

## View HoloLens files on your PC

To see your HoloLens files in File Explorer on your PC:

1. Sign in to HoloLens, then plug it into the PC using the USB cable that came with the HoloLens.

1. Select **Open Device to view files with File Explorer**, or open File Explorer on the PC and navigate to the device.

## Sync to the cloud

To sync photos and other files from your HoloLens to the cloud, install and set up OneDrive on HoloLens. To get OneDrive, search for it in the Microsoft Store on your HoloLens.
