    default VMware PowerCLI fails to connect to thе server.

LONG DESCRIPTION
    When you connect to a server, VMware PowerCLI checks if the server
    certificate is valid. If the certificate is not trusted for this server and
    use, by default VMware PowerCLI fails to connect to the server. Most VMware
    PowerCLI connect cmdlets support the Force parameter that forces the
    connection, even if there is an issue with the server certificate for this
    connection only. The InvalidCertificateAction parameter can change behavior
    based on the following options:

    - Fail (default) - the cmdlet will not establish a connection if the
    certificate is not valid.
    - Warn - the cmdlet will display a warning saying that the certificate is
    not valid, the reason why it is not considered valid, and then will print
    additional information about the certificate.
    - Prompt - if the server certificate is not trusted, the cmdlet will prompt
    you for a course of action before it continues.
    - Ignore - the cmdlet will establish the connection without taking into
    account that the certificate is invalid.
    On PowerShell Core, only the Fail and Ignore values are supported. If you
    want to check the current InvalidCertificateAction parameter, run the
    Get-PowerCLIConfiguration cmdlet. If you want to change the
    InvalidCertificateAction parameter, run Set-PowerCLIConfiguration
    -InvalidCertificateAction <new value>. If the InvalidCertificateAction
    parameter is set to Prompt, the the Invalid Certificate prompt appears.
    You can select one of the four options provided by the Invalid Certificate
    prompt:

    - Deny - Cancel the server connection.
    - Connect once - Establish the server connection and suppress further
    warnings for the current PowerShell session.
    - Add a permanent exception for the server_address/certificate pair -
    Persist the server certificate in the PowerCLI Trusted Certificate Store
    (PCTCS) for the current user and establish the server connection.
    - Add a permanent exception for all users - Persist the server/certificate
    pair both in the current user PowerCLI Trusted Certificate Store (PCTCS) and
    in All Users PCTCS, and establish the server connection.
    To set the default behavior of vSphere PowerCLI when no valid certificates
    are recognized, use the InvalidCertificateAction parameter of the
    Set-PowerCLIConfiguration cmdlet.

POWERCLI TRUSTED CERTIFICATE STORE (PSTCS)
    The PowerCLI Trusted Certificate Store (SslCertificateExceptions.csv) is a
    CSV file with two columns: server_address and certificate_thumbprint. You
    can edit the (PSTCS) manually by using a text editor.

    There are two PSTCS files:

    - The current user PSTCS is located in the <PowerCLI user
    settings>/VMware/PowerCLI directory.
    - The All Users PSTCS is located in the <PowerCLI all user
    settings>/VMware/PowerCLI directory. For more information about the exact
    location depending on your operating system, see the Configuring VMware
    PowerCLI chapter in the VMware PowerCLI User's Guide.
    If you want to make changes to the All Users PSTCS, administrator/root
    privileges might be required. The local certificate storage file is
    purposely simple and you can easily import and export certificates from one
    machine to another or fill it with certificates automatically.
