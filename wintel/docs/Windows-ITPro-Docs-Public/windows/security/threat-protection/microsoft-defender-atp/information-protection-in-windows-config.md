# Configure information protection in Windows 

**Applies to:**

- [Microsoft Defender Advanced Threat Protection (Microsoft Defender ATP)](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2069559)

[!include[Prerelease information](prerelease.md)]

Learn how you can use Microsoft Defender ATP to expand the coverage of Windows Information Protection (WIP) to protect files based on their label, regardless of their origin.

>[!TIP]
> Read our blog post about how [Microsoft Defender ATP integrates with Microsoft Information Protection to discover, protect, and monitor sensitive data on Windows devices](https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/microsoftsecure/2019/01/17/windows-defender-atp-integrates-with-microsoft-information-protection-to-discover-protect-and-monitor-sensitive-data-on-windows-devices/).

If a file meets the criteria set in the policy settings and endpoint data loss prevention setting is also configured, WIP will be enabled for that file.



## Prerequisites
- Endpoints need to be on Windows 10, version 1809 or later
- You need the appropriate license to use the Microsoft Defender ATP and Azure Information Protection integration
- Your tenant needs to be onboarded to Azure Information Protection analytics, for more information, see [Configure a Log Analytics workspace for the reports](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/information-protection/reports-aip#configure-a-log-analytics-workspace-for-the-reports)


## Configure endpoint data loss prevention
Complete the following steps so that Microsoft Defender ATP can automatically identify labeled documents stored on the device and enable WIP on them.

>[!NOTE]
>- The Microsoft Defender ATP configuration is pulled every 15 minutes. Allow up to 30 minutes for the new policy to take effect and ensure that the endpoint is online. Otherwise, it will not receive the policy.
>- Data forwarded to Azure Information Protection is stored in the same location as your other Azure Information Protection data.

1. Define a WIP policy and assign it to the relevant devices. For more information, see [Protect your enterprise data using Windows Information Protection (WIP)](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/security/information-protection/windows-information-protection/protect-enterprise-data-using-wip). If WIP is already configured on the relevant devices, skip this step. 
2. Define which labels need to get WIP protection in Office 365 Security and Compliance. 
    
   1. Go to: **Classifications > Labels**.
   2. Create a label or edit an existing one. 
   3. In the configuration wizard, go to 'Data loss prevention' tab and enable WIP.

   4. Repeat for every label that you want to get WIP applied to in Windows. 




## Configure auto labeling

Windows automatically detects when an Office file, CSV, or TXT files are being created on a device and inspects it based on context to identify sensitive information types.

Those information types are evaluated against the auto-labeling policy. If a match is found, it is processed in the same way as if the file was labeled. The file is protected with Endpoint data loss prevention.

>[!NOTE]
> Auto-labeling requires Windows 10, version 1903.


1. In Office 365 Security & Compliance, go to **Classifications > Labels**.

2. Create a new label or edit an existing one. 


3. Set a policy for Data classification:
   
   1. Go through the label creation wizard.
   2. When you reach the Auto labeling page, turn on auto labeling toggle on.
   3. Add a new auto-labeling rule with the conditions that you require.

   4. Validate that "When content matches these conditions" setting is set to "Automatically apply the label".
