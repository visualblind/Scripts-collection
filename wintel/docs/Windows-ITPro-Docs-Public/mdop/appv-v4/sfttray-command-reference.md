# SFTTRAY Command Reference


The Microsoft Application Virtualization (App-V) Client Tray application, sfttray.exe, is the main user interface element of the App-V Client that users will interact with during normal use. This program controls the streaming and starting of all virtual applications and is accessed by right-clicking the icon displayed in the notification area to display the menu of client functions. The menu enables the user to load applications, start a publishing refresh, cancel a request, or change the client to offline mode. The user can also close the Application Virtualization Client Tray application and all active applications by clicking **Exit**.

By default, the icon is displayed whenever a virtual application is started, although you can control this behavior by using SFTTRAY commands. The Application Virtualization Client Tray application also displays a progress bar for each application that is started, as well as status messages about active applications. Clicking the progress bar displays a message that allows you to cancel the loading or starting of an application.

## SFTTRAY Commands


The list of commands and command-line switches can be displayed by running the following command from a command window.

**Note**  
There is only one Application Virtualization Client Tray instance for each user context, so if you start a new SFTTRAY command, it will be passed to the program that is already running.



`Sfttray.exe /?`

### Command Usage

`Sfttray.exe [/HIDE | /SHOW]`

`Sfttray.exe [/HIDE | /SHOW] [/QUIET] [/EXE alternate-exe] /LAUNCH app [args]`

**Note**  
¹ The */LAUNCHRESULT* command line parameter provides a means for the process that launches sfttray.exe to specify the root name for a global event and a memory mapped file that are used to return the launch result code to the process. The unique identifier name should start with “SFT-” to prevent the event name from getting virtualized when the launching process is invoked within a virtual environment. The memory mapped region will be 64 bits in size.

To use this parameter, the launching process creates an event with the name “&lt;UNIQUE ID&gt;-result\_event”, a memory mapped file with the name “&lt;UNIQUE ID&gt;-result\_value”, and optionally an event with the name “&lt;UNIQUE ID&gt;-shutdown\_event”, and then the launching process launches sfttray.exe and waits on the event to be signaled. After the event “&lt;UNIQUE ID&gt;-result\_event” is signaled, the launching process retrieves the 64-bit return code from the memory mapped region.

If the optional event “&lt;UNIQUE ID&gt;-shutdown\_event” exists when the virtual application exits, sfttray.exe opens and signals the event. The launching process waits on this shutdown event if it needs to determine when the virtual application exits.
