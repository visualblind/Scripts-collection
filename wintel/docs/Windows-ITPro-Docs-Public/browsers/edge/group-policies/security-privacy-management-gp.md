# Security and privacy 

> [!NOTE]
> You've reached the documentation for Microsoft Edge version 45 and earlier. To see the documentation for Microsoft Edge version 77 or later, go to the [Microsoft Edge documentation landing page](https://docs.microsoft.com/DeployEdge/).

Microsoft Edge is designed with improved security in mind, helping to defend people from increasingly sophisticated and prevalent web-based attacks against Windows. Because Microsoft Edge is designed like a Universal Windows app, changing the browser to an app, it fundamentally changes the process model so that both the outer manager process and the different content processes all live within app container sandboxes. 

Microsoft Edge runs in 64-bit not just by default, but anytime it’s running on a 64-bit operating system. Because Microsoft Edge doesn’t support legacy ActiveX controls or 3rd-party binary extensions, there’s no longer a reason to run 32-bit processes on a 64-bit system. 

The value of running 64-bit all the time is that it strengthens Windows Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR), randomizing the memory layout of the browser processes, making it much harder for attackers to hit precise memory locations. In turn, 64-bit processes make ASLR much more effective by making the address space exponentially larger and, therefore, more difficult for attackers to find sensitive memory components. 

For more details on the security features in Microsoft Edge, see [Help protect against web-based security threats](#help-protect-against-web-based-security-threats) below.

## Help protect against web-based security threats

While most websites are safe, some sites have been intentionally designed to steal sensitive and private information or gain access to your system’s resources. You can help protect against threats by using strong security protocols to ensure against such threats.

Thieves use things like _phishing_ attacks to convince someone to enter personal information, such as a banking password, into a website that looks like a legitimate bank but isn't. Attempts to identify legitimate websites through the HTTPS lock symbol and the EV Cert green bar have met with only limited success since attackers are too good at faking legitimate experiences for many people to notice the difference.

Another method thieves often use _hacking_ to attack a system through malformed content that exploits subtle flaws in the browser or various browser extensions. This exploit lets an attacker run code on a device, taking over a browsing session, and perhaps the entire device.

Microsoft Edge addresses these threats to help make browsing the web a safer experience.

Microsoft Edge doesn’t support 3rd party binary extensions, so there is no reason for it to run outside of the container, making Microsoft Edge more secure.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

So if anything goes wrong, the entire browser itself can be compromised or go down. We encourage everyone to use our scripted HTML5-based extension model. For more info about the new extensions, see the [Microsoft Edge Developer Center](https://developer.microsoft.com/microsoft-edge/extensions/).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

Many IE browser vulnerabilities only appear in legacy document modes, so removing support reduced attack surface making the browser more secure. <p>It also means that it’s not as backward compatible. With this reduced backward compatibility, Microsoft Edge automatically falls back to Internet Explorer 11 for any apps that need backward compatibility.  This fall back happens when you use the Enterprise Mode Site List.                                                                                                                                                                       |
