# Sideload LOB apps in Windows 10
**Applies to**

-   Windows 10
-   Windows 10 Mobile

> [!NOTE]
> As of Windows Insider Build 18956, sideloading is enabled by default. Now, you can deploy a signed package onto a device without a special configuration. 

"Line-of-Business" (LOB) apps are present in a wide range of businesses and organizations. Organizations value these apps because they solve problems unique to each business.

When you sideload an app, you deploy a signed app package to a device. You maintain the signing, hosting, and deployment of these apps. Sideloading was also available with Windows 8 and Windows 8.1

In Windows 10, sideloading is different than in earlier versions of Windows:

-   You can unlock a device for sideloading using an enterprise policy, or through **Settings**

-   License keys are not required

-   Devices do not have to be joined to a domain

## Requirements
Here's what you'll need to have:

-   Devices need to be unlocked for sideloading (unlock policy enabled)

-   Certificate assigned to app

-   Signed app package

And here's what you'll need to do:

-   Turn on sideloading - you can push a policy with an MDM provider, or you can use **Settings**.

-   Trust the app - import the security certificate to the local device.

-   Install the app - use PowerShell to install the app package.

## How do I sideload an app on desktop
You can sideload apps on managed or unmanaged devices.

>[!IMPORTANT]
> To install an app on Windows 10, in addition to following [these procedures](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/msix/app-installer/installing-windows10-apps-web), users can also double-click any APPX/MSIX package.
