# How to Configure the App-V Client Registry Settings by Using the Command Line


After the Application Virtualization (App-V) Client has been deployed and configured during the installation by using the command line, it might be necessary to change one or more client configuration settings. This is accomplished by editing the appropriate registry keys, using one of the following methods:

-   Using the Registry Editor directly

-   Using a .reg file

-   Using a scripting language such as VBScript or Windows PowerShell

There is also an ADM template that you can use. For more information about the ADM template, see <https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=121835>.

**Caution**  
Use care when you edit the registry because errors can leave the computer in an unusable state. Be sure to follow your standard business practices that relate to registry edits. Thoroughly test all proposed changes in a test environment before you deploy them to production computers.
