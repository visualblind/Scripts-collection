# Review GPO Settings


You can generate HTML-based and XML-based reports for reviewing settings within any version of a Group Policy Object (GPO).

A user account with the Reviewer, Editor, Approver, or AGPM Administrator (Full Control) role or necessary permissions in Advanced Group Policy Management (AGPM) is required to complete this procedure. Review the details in "Additional considerations" in this topic.

**To review settings in any version of a GPO**

1.  In the **Group Policy Management Console** tree, click **Change Control** in the forest and domain in which you want to manage GPOs.

2.  On the **Contents** tab in the details pane, click a tab to display GPOs.

3.  Double-click the GPO to display its history.

4.  Right-click the GPO version for which to review the settings, click **Settings**, and then click **HTML Report** or **XML Report** to display a summary of the GPO's settings.

### Additional considerations

-   By default, you must be a Reviewer, an Editor, an Approver, or an AGPM Administrator (Full Control) to perform this procedure. Specifically, you must have **List Contents** and **Read Settings** permissions for the GPO. Also, to display the list of GPOs, you must have **List Contents** permission for the domain.
