# Back up the TPM recovery information to AD DS

**Applies to**
-   Windows 10, version 1511
-   Windows 10, version 1507

**Does not apply to**

-   Windows 10, version 1607 or later

With Windows 10, versions 1511 and 1507, you can back up a computer’s Trusted Platform Module (TPM) information to Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS). By doing this, you can use AD DS to administer the TPM from a remote computer. The procedure is the same as it was for Windows 8.1. For more information, see [Backup the TPM Recovery Information to AD DS](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dn466534(v=ws.11).aspx).
