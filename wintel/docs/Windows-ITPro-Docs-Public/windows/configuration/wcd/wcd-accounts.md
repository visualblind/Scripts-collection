# Accounts (Windows Configuration Designer reference)

Use these settings to join a device to an Active Directory domain or an Azure Active Directory tenant, or to add local user accounts to the device.

## Applies to

| Setting groups | Desktop editions | Mobile editions | Surface Hub | HoloLens | IoT Core |
| --- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| [Azure](#azure) | X | X | X | X |  |
| [ComputerAccount](#computeraccount) | X |   | X |   |  X |
| [Users](#users) | X |  | X | X |  |


## Azure

The **Azure > Authority** and **Azure > BPRT** settings for bulk Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) enrollment can only be configured using one of the provisioning wizards. After you get a bulk token for Azure AD enrollment in a wizard, you can switch to the advanced editor to configure additional provisioning settings. For information about using the wizards, see:

- [Instructions for desktop wizard](../provisioning-packages/provision-pcs-for-initial-deployment.md)
- [Instructions for the mobile wizard](../mobile-devices/provisioning-configure-mobile.md)
- [Instructions for the kiosk wizard](../kiosk-single-app.md#wizard)

## ComputerAccount

Specifies the settings you can configure when joining a device to a domain, including the computer name and the account to use for joining the computer to the domain.

>[!NOTE]
>If you want to create a provisioning package that joins a device to Active Directory AND sets `HideOobe`, and you want to apply that package during OOBE, we also recommend setting the `ComputerName` and creating a local admin account in the provisioning package.
