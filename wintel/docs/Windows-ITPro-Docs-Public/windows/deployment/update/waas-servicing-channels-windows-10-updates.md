# Assign devices to servicing channels for Windows 10 updates


**Applies to**

- WindowsÂ 10


> **Looking for consumer information?** See [Windows Update: FAQ](https://support.microsoft.com/help/12373/windows-update-faq) 

>[!TIP]
>If you're not familiar with the Windows 10 servicing or release channels, read [Servicing Channels](waas-overview.md#servicing-channels) first.
>
>Due to [naming changes](waas-overview.md#naming-changes), older terms like CB and CBB might still be displayed in some of our products, such as in Group Policy. If you encounter these terms, "CB" refers to the Semi-Annual Channel (Targeted)--which is no longer used--while "CBB" refers to the Semi-Annual Channel.

The Semi-Annual Channel is the default servicing channel for all Windows 10 devices except those with the LTSB edition installed. The following table shows the servicing channels available to each Windows 10 edition.

>The LTSB edition of Windows 10 is only available through the [Microsoft Volume Licensing Center](https://www.microsoft.com/Licensing/servicecenter/default.aspx).



## Assign devices to Semi-Annual Channel

>[!IMPORTANT]
>Due to [naming changes](waas-overview.md#naming-changes), older terms like CB and CBB might still be displayed in some of our products, such as in Group Policy. If you encounter these terms, "CB" refers to the Semi-Annual Channel (Targeted)--which is no longer used--while "CBB" refers to the Semi-Annual Channel.

**To assign a single devices locally to the Semi-Annual Channel**

1. Go to **Settings** > **Update & security** > **Windows Update** > **Advanced options**.
2. Select **Defer feature updates**.

**To assign devicess to the Semi-Annual Channel by using Group Policy**


- In Windows 10, version 1607 and later releases:

    Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > Windows Components > Windows Update > Defer Windows Updates > **Select when Feature Updates are received** - enable policy and set branch readiness level to the Semi-Annual Channel
    
**To assign devicess to to the Semi-Annual Channel by using MDM**


- In Windows 10, version 1607 and later releases:

    ../Vendor/MSFT/Policy/Config/Update/**BranchReadinessLevel**
    
**To assign Windows 10 Mobile Enterprise devices to the Semi-Annual Channel by using MDM**


- In Windows 10 Mobile Enterprise, version 1607 and later releases:

    ../Vendor/MSFT/Policy/Config/Update/BranchReadinessLevel

## Enroll devices in the Windows Insider Program

To get started with the Windows Insider Program for Business, you will need to follow a few simple steps:

1. On the [Windows Insider](https://insider.windows.com) website, go to **For Business > Getting Started** to [register your organizational Azure AD account](https://insider.windows.com/en-us/insidersigninaad/).
2. **Register your domain**. Rather than have each user register individually for Insider Preview builds, administrators can simply [register their domain](https://insider.windows.com/en-us/for-business-organization-admin/) and control settings centrally.</br>**Note:** The signed-in user needs to be a **Global Administrator** of the Azure AD domain in order to be able to register the domain.
3. Make sure the **Allow Telemetry** setting is set to **2** or higher.
4. Starting with Windows 10, version 1709, set policies to manage preview builds and their delivery:

The **Manage preview builds** setting gives administrators control over enabling or disabling preview build installation on a device. You can also decide to stop preview builds once the release is public.
* Group Policy: **Computer Configuration/Administrative Templates/Windows Components/Windows Update/Windows Update for Business** - *Manage preview builds*
* MDM: **Update/ManagePreviewBuilds**

The **Branch Readiness Level** settings allows you to choose between preview flight rings, and allows you to defer or pause the delivery of updates.
* Group Policy: **Computer Configuration/Administrative Templates/Windows Components/Windows Update/ Windows Update for Business** - *Select when Preview Builds and Feature Updates are received*
* MDM: **Update/BranchReadinessLevel**

For more information, see [Windows Insider Program for Business](waas-windows-insider-for-business.md)

## Block access to Windows Insider Program

To prevent devices in your enterprise from being enrolled in the Insider Program for early releases of Windows 10:

- Group Policy: Computer Configuration\Administrative Templates\Windows Components\Data Collection and Preview Builds\\**Toggle user control over Insider builds**
- MDM: Policy CSP - [System/AllowBuildPreview](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/dn904962%28v=vs.85%29.aspx#System_AllowBuildPreview)

>[!IMPORTANT]
>Starting with Windows 10, version 1709, this policy is replaced by **Manage preview builds** policy.
> * Group Policy: **Computer Configuration/Administrative Templates/Windows Components/Windows Update/Windows Update for Business** - *Manage preview builds*
> * MDM: **Update/ManagePreviewBuilds**


## Switching channels

During the life of a device, it might be necessary or desirable to switch between the available channels. Depending on the channel you are using, the exact mechanism for doing this can be different; some will be simple, others more involved.

## Block user access to Windows Update settings

In Windows 10, administrators can control user access to Windows Update.
By enabling the Group Policy setting under **Computer Configuration\Administrative Templates\Windows Components\Windows update\Remove access to use all Windows update features**, administrators can disable the "Check for updates" option for users. Any background update scans, downloads and installations will continue to work as configured.

>[!NOTE]
> In Windows 10, any Group Policy user configuration settings for Windows Update were deprecated and are no longer supported on this platform.
