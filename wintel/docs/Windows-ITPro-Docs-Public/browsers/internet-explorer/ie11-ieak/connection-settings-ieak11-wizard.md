# Use the Connection Settings page in the IEAK 11 Wizard
The **Connection Settings** page of the Internet Explorer Administration Kit (IEAK 11) Customization Wizard lets you import the connection settings from your computer, to preset the connection settings on your employee’s computers.

**Note**<br>Using the options on the **Additional Settings** page of the wizard, you can let your employees change their connection settings. For more information see the [Additional Settings](additional-settings-ieak11-wizard.md) page. You can also customize additional connection settings using the **Automatic Configuration** page in the wizard. For more information see the [Automatic Configuration](auto-config-ieak11-wizard.md) page.

**To view your current connection settings**

1.  Open IE, click the **Tools** menu, click **Internet Options**, and then click the **Connections** tab.

2.  Click **Settings** to view your dial-up settings and click **LAN Settings** to view your network settings.

**To use the Connection Settings page**

1. Decide if you want to customize your connection settings. You can pick:

   -   **Do not customize Connection Settings.** Pick this option if you don’t want to preset your employee’s connection settings.

   -   **Import the current Connection Settings from this machine.** Pick this option to import your connection settings from your computer and use them as the preset for your employee’s connection settings.
 
   **Note**<br>If you want to change any of your settings later, you can click **Modify Settings** to open the **Internet Properties** box, click the **Connection Settings** tab, and make your changes.

2. Check the **Delete existing Dial-up Connection Settings** box to clear any existing settings on your employee’s computers.

3. Click **Next** to go to the [Automatic Configuration](auto-config-ieak11-wizard.md) page or **Back** to go to the [Connection Manager](connection-mgr-ieak11-wizard.md) page.
