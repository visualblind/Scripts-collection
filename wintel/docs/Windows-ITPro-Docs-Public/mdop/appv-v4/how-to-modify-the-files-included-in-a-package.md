# How to Modify the Files Included in a Package


After you sequence an application but before you save it, you can manually modify a sequenced application package to specify how it will retain its settings. Use the Sequencer attributes section to specify whether a file in a sequenced application package will be available to a specific user or to all users in the community.

**To modify Sequencer attributes**

1.  Click the **Files** tab.

2.  Select **User Data** or **Application Data**, depending on how you want an application to retain its settings, and select **Override** to enable the client to overwrite the cached application.

3.  Click **Apply**.
