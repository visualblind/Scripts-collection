# How to Modify an Existing Virtual Application Package (App-V 4.6 SP1)


Use the following procedures to modify an existing virtual application package. You can use these procedures to:

-   Update an application that is part of an existing virtual application package. To perform this task, use the procedure **"To update an application in an existing application package"** in this document.

-   Modify the properties associated with an existing virtual application package. To perform this task, use the procedure **"To modify the properties associated with an existing virtual application package"** in this document.

-   Add a new application to an existing virtual application package. To perform this task, use the procedure **"To add a new application to an existing virtual application package"** in this document.

You must have the App-V Sequencer installed to modify a virtual application package. For more information about installing the App-V Sequencer, see [How to Install the Sequencer (App-V 4.6 SP1)](how-to-install-the-sequencer---app-v-46-sp1-.md).

**To update an application in an existing virtual application package**

1.  To start the App-V Sequencer, on the computer that is running the App-V Sequencer, click **Start** / **All Programs** / **Microsoft Application Virtualization** / **Microsoft Application Virtualization Sequencer**.

2.  In the App-V Sequencer, click **Modify an Existing Virtual Application Package**, and then click **Next**.

4.  On the **Select Package** page, click **Browse** to locate the virtual application package that contains the application that you want to update, and then click **Next**.

5.  On the **Prepare Computer** page, review the issues that could cause the application update to fail, or for the application update to contain unnecessary data. We strongly recommend that you resolve all potential issues before you continue. After you have fixed the conflicts, to update the information that is displayed, click **Refresh**. After you have resolved all potential issues, click **Next**.

    **Important**  
    If you are required to disable virus scanning software, scan the computer running the sequencer to ensure that no unwanted or malicious files are added to the package.

     

6.  On the **Select Installer** page, click **Browse** and specify the update installation file for the application. If the update does not have an associated installer file and you plan to run all installation steps manually, select the **Select this option to perform a custom installation** check box, and then click **Next**.

7.  On the **Installation** page, when the sequencer and application installer are ready, install the application update so the sequencer can monitor the installation process. If additional installation files must be run as part of the installation, click **Run** and locate and run the additional installation files. When you are finished with the installation, select **I am finished installing**. Click **Next**.

    **Note**  
    The sequencer monitors all changes and installations to the computer running the sequencer, including the changes and installations that are performed outside of the sequencing wizard.
