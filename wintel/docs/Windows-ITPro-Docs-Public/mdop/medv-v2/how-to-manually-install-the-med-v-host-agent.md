# How to Manually Install the MED-V Host Agent


There are two separate but related components to the Microsoft Enterprise Desktop Virtualization (MED-V) 2.0 solution: the MED-V Host Agent and Guest Agent. The Host Agent resides on the host computer (a user’s computer that is running Windows 7) and provides a channel to communicate with the MED-V guest (the MED-V virtual machine running in the host computer). It also provides certain MED-V related functionality, such as application publishing.

Typically, you deploy and install the MED-V Host Agent by using your company’s preferred method of provisioning software. However, before deploying MED-V across your enterprise, you might prefer to install the Host Agent locally for testing. This section provides step-by-step instructions for manually installing the MED-V Host Agent.

**Note**  
The MED-V Guest Agent is installed automatically during first time setup.

 

**Important**  
Close Internet Explorer before you install the MED-V Host Agent, otherwise conflicts can occur later with URL redirection. You can also do this by specifying a computer restart during a distribution.

 

**To install the MED-V Host Agent**

1.  Locate the MED-V installation files that you received as part of your software download.

2.  Double-click the MED-V\_HostAgent\_Setup installation file.

    The **Microsoft Enterprise Desktop Virtualization (MED-V) Host Agent Setup** wizard opens. Click **Next** to continue.

3.  Accept the Microsoft Software License Terms, and then click **Next**.

4.  Select the destination folder for installing the MED-V Host Agent. Click **Next**.

5.  To begin the Host Agent installation, click **Install**.

6.  After the installation is completed successfully, click **Finish** to close the wizard.

    To verify that the installation of the Host Agent was successful, click **Start**, click **All Programs**, click **Microsoft Enterprise Desktop Virtualization**, and then click **MED-V Host Agent**.

**Note**  
Until a MED-V workspace is installed, the MED-V Host Agent can be started and runs, but provides no functionality.
