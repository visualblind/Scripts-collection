# App-V Client Registry Values


The Microsoft Application Virtualization (App-V) client stores its configuration in the registry. You can gather some useful information about the client if you understand the format of data in the registry. You can also configure many client actions by changing registry entries. This topic lists all the Application Virtualization (App-V) client registry keys and explains their uses.

**Important**  
On a computer running a 64-bit operating system, the keys and values described in the following sections will be under HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Wow6432Node\\Microsoft\\SoftGrid\\4.5\\Client.



## Configuration Key


The following table provides information about the registry values associated with the HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\SoftGrid\\4.5\\Client\\Configuration key.

## Permissions Key


To help to prevent users from making mistakes, administrators can use the HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\SoftGrid\\4.5\\Client\\Permissions key to control access to some actions for non-administrative users—for example, to prevent users from accidentally unloading programs. Users with administrative rights can give themselves any of these permissions. On shared systems, such as a Remote Desktop Session Host (RD Session Host) server (formerly Terminal Server) system, be careful when granting additional permissions to users because some of these permissions would enable users to control the applications used by all users on the system. Possible values for these settings are 1 (allow) and 0 (disallow).

The Permissions key settings control all interfaces that enable the named actions. This includes the Options Dialog, SFTTray, and SFTMime. These settings do not affect administrators. The following table provides information about the registry values associated with the Permissions key.

Name 
Type 
Data (Examples) 
Description 
ChangeFSDrive

DWORD

Default=0

A value of 1 allows users to pick a different drive letter to be used as the file system drive.

ChangeCacheSize

DWORD

Default=0

A value of 1 allows users to change the cache size.

ChangeLogSettings

DWORD

Default=0

A value of 1 allows users to modify the log level, change its location, and reset it through the user interface.

AddApp

DWORD

Default=0

A value of 1 allows users to add applications explicitly. This does not affect applications that are added through publishing refresh nor does it prevent users from starting (and thereby implicitly adding) applications that have not already been added. Values are 0 or 1.

LoadApp 

DWORD 

0

Does not allow a user to load an application. This is the default for RD Session Hosts. If you are a mobile user, you might want to fully load your applications in the cache to use them during disconnected operation or offline mode. To stream applications from the App-V Management Server or the App-V Streaming Server, you must be connected to a server to load applications.

1

Allows a user to load an application. This is the default for Windows desktops. 

UnloadApp 

DWORD 

0

Does not allow a user to unload an application. When you load or unload a package, all the applications in the package are loaded into or removed from cache.

1

Allows a user to unload an application. 

LockApp 

DWORD 

0

Does not allow a user to lock and unlock an application. This is the default for RD Session Hosts. A locked application cannot be removed from the cache to make room for new applications. To remove a locked application from the App-V Desktop or Client for Remote Desktop Services (formerly Terminal Services) cache, you must unlock it.

1

Allows a user to lock and unlock an application. This is the default for Windows Desktops. 

ManageTypes 

DWORD 

0

Does not allow a user to add, edit, or remove file type associations for that User alone. This is the default for RD Session Hosts. 

1

Allows a user to add, edit, and remove file type associations for that user only and not globally. This is the default for Windows Desktops. 

RefreshServer 

DWORD 

0

Does not allow a user to trigger a refresh of MIME settings. This is the default for RD Session Hosts. 

1

Enables a user to trigger a refresh of MIME settings. This is the default for Windows Desktops. 

UpdateOSDFile

DWORD

Default= 0

A value of 1 enables a user to use a modified OSD file.

ImportApp 

DWORD 

0

Does not allow a user to import applications into cache. The difference between Load and Import is that when a Load is triggered, the client gets the package from the currently configured location contained in the OSD, ASR, or Override URL. When using Import, a location to get the package from must be specified. 

1

Allows a user to import applications into cache. 

ChangeRefreshSettings

DWORD

Default=0

A value of 1 allows users to modify the refresh settings for servers (refresh on login and periodic refresh). This does not imply that the user can modify other server settings (path, host, and so on).

ManageServers

DWORD

Default=0

A value of 1 allows the user to add, edit, and remove servers, except for editing the refresh settings, which is controlled by the ChangeRefreshSettings permission.

PublishShortcut

DWORD

Default=0

A value of 1 allows users to publish shortcuts through the user interface. This does not affect shortcuts that are published during a publishing refresh.

ViewAllApplications

DWORD

Default=0

A value of 1 displays all applications through the user interface; otherwise, only the user’s applications are displayed.

RepairApp

DWORD

Default=1

A value of 1 allows the user to use the Repair action on applications in SFTMime or the Client Management Console. When you repair an application, you remove any custom user settings and restore the default settings. This action does not change or delete shortcuts or file type associations, and it does not remove the application from cache.

ClearApp

DWORD

Default=1

A value of 1 allows the user to use the Clear action on applications in SFTMime or the Client Management Console. When you clear an application from the console, you can no longer use that application. However, the application remains in cache and is still available to other users on the same system. After a publishing refresh, the cleared applications will again become available to you.

DeleteApp

DWORD

Default=0

A value of 1 allows the user to use the Delete action on applications in SFTMime or the Client Management Console. When you delete an application, the selected application will no longer be available to any users on that client. Shortcuts and file type associations are deleted and the application is deleted from cache. However, if another application refers to data in the file system cache or settings data for the selected application, these items will not be deleted.

After a publishing refresh, the deleted applications will again become available to you.

ToggleOfflineMode

DWORD

A value of 1 allows the users to select to run the client in Offline Mode. In Offline Mode, the Application Virtualization client can start a loaded application even when it is not connected to an Application Virtualization Server.



## Custom Settings

## Reporting Settings


The HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\SoftGrid\\4.5\\Client\\Reporting key contains values specific to reporting to an App-V Management Server. The following table provides information about the registry values associated with the Reporting key.

<td align="left"><p>DWORD</p></td>
<td align="left"><p>Default=20</p></td>
<td align="left"><p>This value specifies the maximum size in megabytes (MB) of the XML cache for storing reporting information. The size applies to the cache in memory. When the limit is reached, the log file will roll over. When a new record is added (bottom of the list), one or more of the oldest records (top of the list) will be deleted to make room. A warning will be logged to the Client log and the event log the first time this occurs, and it will not be logged again until after the cache has been successfully cleared on transmission and the log has filled up again.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td align="left"><p>DataBlockSize</p></td>
<td align="left"><p>DWORD</p></td>
<td align="left"><p>Default=65536</p></td>
<td align="left"><p>This value specifies the maximum size in bytes to transmit to the server at once on publishing refresh, to avoid permanent transmission failures when the log has reached a significant size. The default value is 65536. When transmitting report data to the server, one block of application records—less than or equal to the block size in bytes of XML data—will be removed from the cache and sent to the server. Each block will have the general Client data and global package list data prepended, and these will not factor into the block size calculations; the potential exists for an extremely large package list to result in transmission failures over low bandwidth or unreliable connections.</p></td>
