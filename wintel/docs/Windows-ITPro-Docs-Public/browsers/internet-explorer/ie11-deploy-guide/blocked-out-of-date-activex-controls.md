# Blocked out-of-date ActiveX controls

ActiveX controls are small apps that let websites provide content, like videos and games, and let you interact with content, like toolbars. Unfortunately, because many ActiveX controls aren't automatically updated, they can become outdated as new versions are released. It's very important that you keep your ActiveX controls up to date because malicious software (or malware) can target security flaws in outdated controls, damaging your computer by collecting info from it, installing unwanted software, or by letting someone else control it remotely. To help avoid this situation, Internet Explorer includes a security feature called _out-of-date ActiveX control blocking_.

We'll periodically update this page with new ActiveX controls blocked by this feature. We'll typically provide one month's advance notice before adding new controls to the list.

You will receive a notification if a webpage tries to load one of the following of ActiveX control versions:

**Java**
