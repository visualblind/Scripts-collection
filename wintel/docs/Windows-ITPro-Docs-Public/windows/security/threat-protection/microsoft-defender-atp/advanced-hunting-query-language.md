# Learn the Advanced hunting query language

**Applies to:**
- [Microsoft Defender Advanced Threat Protection (Microsoft Defender ATP)](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2069559)

Advanced hunting is based on the [Kusto query language](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/kusto/query/). You can use Kusto syntax and operators to construct queries that locate information in the [schema](advanced-hunting-schema-reference.md) specifically structured for Advanced hunting. To understand these concepts better, run your first query.

## Try your first query

In Microsoft Defender Security Center, go to **Advanced hunting** to run your first query. Use the following example:

```
// Finds PowerShell execution events that could involve a download.
ProcessCreationEvents  
| where EventTime > ago(7d)
| where FileName in ("powershell.exe", "POWERSHELL.EXE", "powershell_ise.exe", "POWERSHELL_ISE.EXE") 
| where ProcessCommandLine has "Net.WebClient"
        or ProcessCommandLine has "DownloadFile"
        or ProcessCommandLine has "Invoke-WebRequest"
        or ProcessCommandLine has "Invoke-Shellcode"
        or ProcessCommandLine contains "http:"
| project EventTime, ComputerName, InitiatingProcessFileName, FileName, ProcessCommandLine
| top 100 by EventTime'
```

This is how it will look like in Advanced hunting.

### Describe the query and specify the table to search
The query starts with a short comment describing what it is for. This helps if you later decide to save your query and share it with others in your organization.

```
// Finds PowerShell execution events that could involve a download.
ProcessCreationEvents
```

The query itself will typically start with a table name followed by a series of elements started by a pipe (`|`). In this example, we start by adding  with the table name `ProcessCreationEvents` and add piped elements as needed.

### Set the time range
The first piped element is a time filter scoped within the previous seven days. Keeping the time range as narrow as possible ensures that queries perform well, return manageable results, and don't time out.

```
| where EventTime > ago(7d)
```
### Search for specific executable files
The time range is immediately followed by a search for files representing the PowerShell application.

```
| where FileName in ("powershell.exe", "POWERSHELL.EXE", "powershell_ise.exe", "POWERSHELL_ISE.EXE")
```
### Search for specific command lines
Afterwards, the query looks for command lines that are typically used with PowerShell to download files.

```
| where ProcessCommandLine has "Net.WebClient"
        or ProcessCommandLine has "DownloadFile"
        or ProcessCommandLine has "Invoke-WebRequest"
        or ProcessCommandLine has "Invoke-Shellcode"
        or ProcessCommandLine contains "http:"
```
### Select result columns and length 
Now that your query clearly identifies the data you want to locate, you can add elements that define what the results look like. `project` returns specific columns and `top` limits the number of results, making the results well-formatted and reasonably large and easy to process.

```
| project EventTime, ComputerName, InitiatingProcessFileName, FileName, ProcessCommandLine
| top 100 by EventTime'
```

Click **Run query** to see the results. You can expand the screen view so you can focus on your hunting query and the results.

## Learn common query operators for Advanced hunting

Now that you've run your first query and have a general idea of its components, it's time to backtrack a little bit and learn some basics. The Kusto query language used by Advanced hunting supports a range of operators, including the following common ones.

| Operator | Description and usage |
|--|--|
| **where** | Filter a table to the subset of rows that satisfy a predicate. |
| **summarize** | Produce a table that aggregates the content of the input table. |
| **join** | Merge the rows of two tables to form a new table by matching values of the specified column(s) from each table. |
| **count** | Return the number of records in the input record set. |
| **top** | Return the first N records sorted by the specified columns. |
| **limit** | Return up to the specified number of rows. |
| **project** | Select the columns to include, rename or drop, and insert new computed columns. |
| **extend** | Create calculated columns and append them to the result set. |
| **makeset** |  Return a dynamic (JSON) array of the set of distinct values that Expr takes in the group. |
| **find** | Find rows that match a predicate across a set of tables. |

To see a live example of these operators, run them from the **Get started** section of the Advanced hunting page.

## Understand data types

Data in Advanced hunting tables are generally classified into the following data types.

| Data type | Description and query implications |
|--|--|
| **datetime** | Data and time information typically representing event timestamps |
| **string** | Character string |
| **bool** | True or false |
| **int** | 32-bit numeric value  |
| **long** | 64-bit numeric value |

## Use sample queries

The **Get started** section provides a few simple queries using commonly used operators. Try running these queries and making small modifications to them.

>Apart from the basic query samples, you can also access [shared queries](advanced-hunting-shared-queries.md) for specific threat hunting scenarios. Explore the shared queries on the left side of the page or the GitHub query repository.
