# How to Print a Report


The process for printing a report for the Application Virtualization Server Management Console is the same regardless of the report type.

**To print a report**

1.  After the report output is displayed in the **Results** pane, click the **Printer** button (at the top of the **Results** pane) or right-click the desired report under the **Reports** node and select **Print** from the pop-up menu.

2.  Follow the printing prompts, and click **OK**.
