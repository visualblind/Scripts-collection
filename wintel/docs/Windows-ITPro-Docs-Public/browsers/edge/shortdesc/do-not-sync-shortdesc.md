By default, Microsoft Edge turns on the _Sync your settings_ toggle in **Settings > Device sync settings** letting users choose what to sync on their devices. Enabling this policy turns off and disables the _Sync your settings_ toggle preventing the syncing of userâ€™s settings between their devices. If you want syncing turned off by default in Microsoft Edge but not disabled, enable this policy and select the _Allow users to turn syncing on_ option.
