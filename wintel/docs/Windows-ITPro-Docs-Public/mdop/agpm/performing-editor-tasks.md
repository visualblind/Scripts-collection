# Performing Editor Tasks


An Editor is a person authorized by an AGPM Administrator (Full Control) to make changes to Group Policy objects (GPOs) and create GPO templates. Additionally, an Editor can initiate the process of creating or deleting a GPO, but by default must request approval from an Approver.

**Important**  
Ensure that you are connecting to the central archive for GPOs. For more information, see [Configure the AGPM Server Connection](configure-the-agpm-server-connection-reviewer.md).

 

-   [Creating, Controlling, or Importing a GPO](creating-controlling-or-importing-a-gpo-editor.md)

-   [Editing a GPO](editing-a-gpo.md)

-   [Creating a Template and Setting a Default Template](creating-a-template-and-setting-a-default-template.md)

-   [Delete a GPO](delete-a-gpo-editor.md)

**Note**  
Because the Editor role includes the permissions for the Reviewer role, an Editor can also review settings and compare GPOs. See [Performing Reviewer Tasks](performing-reviewer-tasks.md) for more information.

 

### Additional considerations

By default, the following permissions are provided for the Editor role:

-   List Contents

-   Read Settings

-   Edit Settings

-   Create Template
