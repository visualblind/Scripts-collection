# How to Delete an Application


You can delete an application through the Application Virtualization Server Management Console. This does not delete its Open Software Descriptor (.osd) file for other files from the Application Virtualization Server. After it is deleted, however, the application no longer streams to end users.

**Note**  
If this is the only application in a package, deleting it also removes related package data and file associations.

 

**To delete an application**

1.  In the left pane of the management console, click the **Applications** node.

2.  In the right pane, highlight one or more applications you want to delete. You can use CTRL or Shift key combinations to highlight multiple applications.

3.  Right-click the application or applications, and choose **Delete**.

4.  In the **Remove Application** confirmation prompt, click **Yes** to complete the action.
