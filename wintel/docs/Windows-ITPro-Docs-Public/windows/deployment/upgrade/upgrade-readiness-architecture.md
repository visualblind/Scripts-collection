# Upgrade Readiness architecture

Microsoft analyzes system, application, and driver diagnostic data  to help you determine when computers are upgrade-ready, allowing you to simplify and accelerate Windows upgrades in your organization. The diagram below illustrates how Upgrade Readiness components work together in a typical installation.

After you enable Windows diagnostic data on user computers and install the compatibility update KB (1), user computers send computer, application and driver diagnostic data to a secure Microsoft data center through the Microsoft Data Management Service (2). After you configure Upgrade Readiness, diagnostic data is analyzed by the Upgrade Readiness Service (3) and pushed to your workspace (4). You can then use the Upgrade Readiness solution (5) to plan and manage Windows upgrades.
