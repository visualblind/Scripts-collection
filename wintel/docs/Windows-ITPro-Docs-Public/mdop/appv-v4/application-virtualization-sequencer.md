# Application Virtualization Sequencer


Sequencing is the process by which you create an application package using the Microsoft Application Virtualization (App-V) Sequencer. The App-V Sequencer monitors and records all installation and setup processes for an application and creates the following files: ICO, OSD, SFT, and SPRJ. These files contain all the necessary information about an application, and they allow that application to run in a virtual environment.
