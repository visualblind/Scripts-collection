# Viewing MED-V Workspace Configurations


When you are troubleshooting MED-V issues and problems, you can use the MED-V Administration Toolkit to view the published applications and redirected web addresses in the MED-V workspace. You can also use the MED-V Administration Toolkit to open the MED-V workspace in full-screen mode.

For information about how to open the MED-V Administration Toolkit, see [Troubleshooting MED-V by Using the Administration Toolkit](troubleshooting-med-v-by-using-the-administration-toolkit.md).

## Viewing MED-V Published Applications


On the **MED-V Administration Toolkit** window, click **View Published Applications**.

The **MED-V Workspace Published Applications** window opens and displays a list of the applications that were published in the MED-V workspace. You can use this information to troubleshoot certain issues, such as determining whether an application was published as expected.

For information about how to publish applications to the MED-V workspace, see [How to Publish and Unpublish an Application on the MED-V Workspace](how-to-publish-and-unpublish-an-application-on-the-med-v-workspace.md).

## Viewing MED-V Redirected Web Addresses


On the **MED-V Administration Toolkit** window, click **View Redirected Web Addresses**.

The **Web Addresses Redirected to the MED-V Workspace** window opens and displays a list of the redirected web addresses specified for the MED-V workspace. You can use this information to troubleshoot certain issues, such as determining whether a web address was specified correctly for redirection.

For information about how to manage web addresses redirection in the MED-V workspace, see [How to Add or Remove URL Redirection Information in a Deployed MED-V Workspace](how-to-add-or-remove-url-redirection-information-in-a-deployed-med-v-workspace.md).

## <a href="" id="bkmk-fullscreen"></a>Opening the MED-V Workspace Virtual Machine


On the **MED-V Administration Toolkit** window, click **View MED-V Workspace Full Screen**.

MED-V closes if it was running, and the MED-V workspace virtual machine opens in full-screen mode. You can use this full-screen window to easily access all the components of the virtual machine that might be helpful in troubleshooting, such as its hard disk and settings files.
