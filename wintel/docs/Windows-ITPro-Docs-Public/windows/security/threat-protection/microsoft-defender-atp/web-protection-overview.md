# Protect your organization against web threats

>Want to experience Microsoft Defender ATP? [Sign up for a free trial.](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/windows/microsoft-defender-atp?ocid=docs-wdatp-main-abovefoldlink&rtc=1)

[!include[Prerelease information](prerelease.md)]

Web protection in Microsoft Defender ATP leverages [network protection](network-protection.md) to secure your machines against web threats without relying on a web proxy, providing security for devices that are either away or on premises. By integrating with Microsoft Edge as well as popular third-party browsers like Chrome and Firefox, web protection stops access to phishing sites, malware vectors, exploit sites, untrusted or low-reputation sites, as well as sites that you have blocked in your [custom indicator list](manage-indicators.md).

With web protection, you also get:
- Comprehensive visibility into web threats affecting your organization
- Investigation capabilities over web-related threat activity through alerts and comprehensive profiles of URLs and the machines that access these URLs
- A full set of security features that track general access trends to malicious and unwanted websites

>[!Note]
>It can take up to an hour for machines to receive new customer indicators.

## Prerequisites
Web protection uses network protection to provide web browsing security on Microsoft Edge and third-party web browsers.

To turn on network protection on your machines:
- Edit the Microsoft Defender ATP security baseline under **Web & Network Protection** to enable network protection before deploying or redeploying it. [Learn about reviewing and assigning the Microsoft Defender ATP security baseline](configure-machines-security-baseline.md#review-and-assign-the-microsoft-defender-atp-security-baseline)
- Turn network protection on using Intune device configuration, SCCM, Group Policy, or your MDM solution. [Read more about enabling network protection](enable-network-protection.md)  

>[!Note]
>If you set network protection to **Audit only**, blocking will be unavailable. Also, you will be able to detect and log attempts to access malicious and unwanted websites on Microsoft Edge only.
