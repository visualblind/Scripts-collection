# Investigate a user account in Microsoft Defender ATP

**Applies to:**

- [Microsoft Defender Advanced Threat Protection (Microsoft Defender ATP)](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2069559)

>Want to experience Microsoft Defender ATP? [Sign up for a free trial.](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/windows/microsoft-defender-atp?ocid=docs-wdatp-investigatgeuser-abovefoldlink)

## Investigate user account entities

Identify user accounts with the most active alerts (displayed on dashboard as "Users at risk") and investigate cases of potential compromised credentials, or pivot on the associated user account when investigating an alert or machine to identify possible lateral movement between machines with that user account.

You can find user account information in the following views:

- Dashboard
- Alert queue
- Machine details page

A clickable user account link is available in these views, that will take you to the user account details page where more details about the user account are shown.

When you investigate a user account entity, you'll see:

- User account details, Azure Advanced Threat Protection (Azure ATP) alerts, and Logged on machines
- Alerts related to this user
- Observed in organization (machines logged on to)

The user account details, Azure ATP alerts, and logged on machines cards display various attributes about the user account.

### User details

The **User details** card provides information about the user, such as when the user was first and last seen. Depending on the integration features you've enabled, you'll see other details. For example, if you enable the Skype for business integration, you'll be able to contact the user from the portal.

### Azure Advanced Threat Protection

The **Azure Advanced Threat Protection** card will contain a link that will take you to the Azure ATP page, if you have enabled the Azure ATP feature, and there are alerts related to the user. The Azure ATP page will provide more information about the alerts. This card also provides details such as the last AD site, total group memberships, and login failure associated with the user.

>[!NOTE]
>You'll need to enable the integration on both Azure ATP and Microsoft Defender ATP to use this feature. In Microsoft Defender ATP, you can enable this feature in advanced features. For more information on how to enable advanced features, see [Turn on advanced features](advanced-features.md).

### Logged on machines

The **Logged on machines** card shows a list of the machines that the user has logged on to. You can expand these to see details of the log-on events for each machine.

## Alerts related to this user

The **Alerts related to this user** section provides a list of alerts that are associated with the user account. This list is a filtered view of the [Alert queue](alerts-queue.md), and shows alerts where the user context is the selected user account, the date when the last activity was detected, a short description of the alert, the machine associated with the alert, the alert's severity, the alert's status in the queue, and who is assigned the alert.

## Observed in organization

The **Observed in organization** section allows you to specify a date range to see a list of machines where this user was observed logged on to, the most frequent and least frequent logged on user account for each of these machines, and total observed users on each machine.

Selecting an item on the Observed in organization table will expand the item, revealing more details about the machine. Directly selecting a link within an item will send you to the corresponding page.

## Search for specific user accounts

1. Select **User** from the **Search bar** drop-down menu.
2. Enter the user account in the **Search** field.
3. Click the search icon or press **Enter**.

A list of users matching the query text is displayed. You'll see the user account's domain and name, when the user account was last seen, and the total number of machines it was observed logged on to in the last 30 days.

You can filter the results by the following time periods:

- 1 day
- 3 days
- 7 days
- 30 days
- 6 months
