## 0xC1900101

A frequently observed result code is 0xC1900101. This result code can be thrown at any stage of the upgrade process, with the exception of the downlevel phase. 0xC1900101 is a generic rollback code, and usually indicates that an incompatible driver is present. The incompatible driver can cause blue screens, system hangs, and unexpected reboots. Analysis of supplemental log files is often helpful, such as:<br>

- The minidump file: $Windows.~bt\Sources\Rollback\setupmem.dmp,
- Event logs: $Windows.~bt\Sources\Rollback\*.evtx
- The device install log: $Windows.~bt\Sources\Rollback\setupapi\setupapi.dev.log

The device install log is particularly helpful if rollback occurs during the sysprep operation (extend code 0x30018).  To resolve a rollback due to driver conflicts, try running setup using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs by performing a [clean boot](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135) before initiating the upgrade process.

<br>Check supplemental rollback logs for a setupmem.dmp file, or event logs for any unexpected reboots or errors.
<br>Review the rollback log and determine the stop code.
<br>The rollback log is located in the <strong>C:$Windows.~BT\Sources\Panther</strong> folder.  An example analysis is shown below. This example is not representative of all cases:
<br>Info SP     Crash 0x0000007E detected
<br>Info SP       Module name           :
<br>Info SP       Bugcheck parameter 1  : 0xFFFFFFFFC0000005
<br>Info SP       Bugcheck parameter 2  : 0xFFFFF8015BC0036A
<br>Info SP       Bugcheck parameter 3  : 0xFFFFD000E5D23728
<br>Info SP       Bugcheck parameter 4  : 0xFFFFD000E5D22F40
<br>Info SP     Cannot recover the system.
<br>Info SP     Rollback: Showing splash window with restoring text: Restoring your previous version of Windows.


<br>Typically, there is a dump file for the crash to analyze. If you are not equipped to debug the dump, then attempt the following basic troubleshooting procedures:<br>

1. Make sure you have enough disk space.<br>
2. If a driver is identified in the bug check message, disable the driver or check with the manufacturer for driver updates.<br>
3. Try changing video adapters.<br>
4. Check with your hardware vendor for any BIOS updates.<br>
5. Disable BIOS memory options such as caching or shadowing.

These errors occur during partition analysis and validation, and can be caused by the presence of multiple system partitions. For example, if you installed a new system drive but left the previous system drive connected, this can cause a conflict. To resolve the errors, disconnect or temporarily disable drives that contain the unused system partition. You can reconnect the drive after the upgrade has completed. Alternatively, you can delete the unused system partition.

This error can be due to a problem with user profiles. It can occur due to corrupt registry entries under **HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\ProfileList** or invalid files in the **\\Users** directory.

Note: If a previous upgrade did not complete, invalid profiles might exist in the **Windows.old\\Users** directory.

To repair this error, ensure that deleted accounts are not still present in the Windows registry and that files under the \\Users directory are valid.

Drives that are formatted in FAT32 may run into errors due to FAT32 file size limitations. USB drives are preferred over SD cards because drivers for SD cards are not migrated if the device does not support Connected Standby.
