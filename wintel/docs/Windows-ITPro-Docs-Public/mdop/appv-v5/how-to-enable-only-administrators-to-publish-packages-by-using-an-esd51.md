# How to Enable Only Administrators to Publish Packages by Using an ESD


Starting in App-V 5.0 SP3, you can configure the App-V client so that only administrators (not end users) can publish or unpublish packages. In earlier versions of App-V, you could not prevent end users from performing these tasks.

**To enable only administrators to publish or unpublish packages**

1.  Navigate to the following Group Policy Object node:

    **Computer Configuration &gt; Policies &gt; Administrative Templates &gt; System &gt; App-V &gt; Publishing**.

2.  Enable the **Require publish as administrator** Group Policy setting.

    To alternatively use PowerShell to set this item, see [How to Manage App-V 5.1 Packages Running on a Stand-Alone Computer by Using PowerShell](how-to-manage-app-v-51-packages-running-on-a-stand-alone-computer-by-using-powershell.md#bkmk-admins-pub-pkgs).
