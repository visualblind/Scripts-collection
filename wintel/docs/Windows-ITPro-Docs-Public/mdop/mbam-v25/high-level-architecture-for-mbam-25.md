# High-Level Architecture for MBAM 2.5


Microsoft BitLocker Administration and Monitoring can be deployed in a Stand-alone topology, where you run MBAM as a stand-alone product, or in a topology that is integrated with System Center 2012 R2 Configuration Manager, System Center 2012 Configuration Manager, or Microsoft System Center Configuration Manager 2007. The high-level architecture information describes and illustrates the recommended architecture and servers for each topology and the features that you configure on each server.
