# Configuring MED-V Workspace Policies


A MED-V workspace policy is a group of configurable settings that define how the virtualized environment and applications perform on the host machine. The topics in this section describe all the configurable settings in the MED-V workspace policy as well as how these settings influence the MED-V workspace.

The following MED-V workspace types are available:

-   **Persistent**—In a persistent MED-V workspace, all changes and additions the user makes to the MED-V workspace are saved in the MED-V workspace between sessions. Additionally, a persistent MED-V workspace is generally used in a domain environment.

-   **Revertible**—In a revertible MED-V workspace, at the completion of each session (that is, when the MED-V workspace is stopped), the MED-V workspace reverts to its original state during deployment. No changes or additions that the user made are saved on the MED-V workspace between sessions. A revertible MED-V workspace cannot be used in a domain environment.

It is important to decide on the type of MED-V workspace you are creating before deploying the MED-V workspace, because it is not recommended to reconfigure the type of MED-V workspace after a policy has been deployed to users.

**Note**  
When configuring a policy, a warning symbol appears next to mandatory fields that are not filled in. If a mandatory field is not filled in, the symbol appears on the tab as well.
