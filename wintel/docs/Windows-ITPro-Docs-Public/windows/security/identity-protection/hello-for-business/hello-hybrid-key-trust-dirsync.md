# Configure Directory Synchronization for Hybrid key trust Windows Hello for Business

**Applies to**
-  Windows 10, version 1703 or later
-  Hybrid deployment
-  Key trust

 
You are ready to configure directory synchronization for your hybrid environment. Hybrid Windows Hello for Business deployment needs both a cloud and an on-premises identity to authenticate and access resources in the cloud or on-premises.    

## Deploy Azure AD Connect
Next, you need to synchronize the on-premises Active Directory with Azure Active Directory.  To do this, first review the [Integrating on-prem directories with Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/connect/active-directory-aadconnect) and [hardware and prerequisites](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/connect/active-directory-aadconnect-prerequisites) needed and then [download the software](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=615771).


> [!NOTE]
> If you installed Azure AD Connect prior to upgrading the schema, you will need to re-run the Azure AD Connect installation and refresh the on-premises AD schema to ensure the synchronization rule for msDS-KeyCredentialLink is configured.
