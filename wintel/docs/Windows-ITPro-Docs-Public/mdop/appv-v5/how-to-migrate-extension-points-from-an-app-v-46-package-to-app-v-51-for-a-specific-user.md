# How to Migrate Extension Points From an App-V 4.6 Package to App-V 5.1 for a Specific User


Use the following procedure to migrate packages created with App-V using the user configuration file.

**Note**  
This procedure assumes that you are running the latest version of App-V 4.6.

**To convert a package**

1. Locate the user configuration file for the package you want to convert. To set the policy, perform the following updates in the **userConfiguration** section: **ManagingAuthority TakeoverExtensionPointsFrom46="true" PackageName=&lt;Package ID&gt;**.

   The following is an example of a user configuration file:

   &lt;?xml version="1.0" ?&gt;

   &lt;UserConfiguration PackageId=&lt;Package ID&gt; DisplayName=&lt;Name of the Package&gt;

   xmlns="<http://schemas.microsoft.com/appv/2010/userconfiguration"&gt>; &lt;ManagingAuthority TakeoverExtensionPointsFrom46="true"

   PackageName=&lt;Package ID&gt;

   &lt;/UserConfiguration&gt;

2. To add the App-V 5.1 package, type the following in an elevated PowerShell command prompt window:

   PS&gt;**$pkg= Add-AppvClientPackage –Path** &lt;Path to package location&gt;

   PS&gt;**Publish-AppVClientPackage $pkg -DynamicUserConfiguration** &lt;Path to the user configuration file&gt;

3. Open the application using FTAs or shortcuts now. The application should open using App-V 5.1.

   The App-V 4.6 package and the converted App-V 5.1 package are published to the user, but the FTAs and shortcuts for the applications have been assumed by the App-V 5.1 package.
