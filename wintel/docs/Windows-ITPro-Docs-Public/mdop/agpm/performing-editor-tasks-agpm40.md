# Performing Editor Tasks


In Advanced Group Policy Management (AGPM), an Editor is a person authorized by an AGPM Administrator (Full Control) to change Group Policy Objects (GPOs) and create GPO templates. Additionally, an Editor can request that a GPO be created, deleted, or restored. An Approver must approve the request for it to be implemented. An Editor can export a GPO to a file so that it can be copied to a domain in another forest, and import a GPO that was copied from another domain.

**Important**  
Make sure that you are connecting to the central archive for GPOs. For more information, see [Configure an AGPM Server Connection](configure-an-agpm-server-connection-agpm40.md).

**Note**  
Because the Editor role includes the permissions for the Reviewer role, an Editor can also review settings and compare GPOs. See [Performing Reviewer Tasks](performing-reviewer-tasks-agpm40.md) for more information.

 

### Additional considerations

By default, the following permissions are provided for the Editor role:

-   List Contents
