# Configuring Windows Firewall for App-V


Securing the communication between components in an App-V infrastructure is only one element in securing the environment. Using a firewall program on the server can help reduce the attack surface area. The topics in this section provide procedures for configuring Windows built-in firewall capabilities that support App-V. These procedures assume that you installed a Management Server and that it has been configured for RTSPS communication. Notes are included in the procedures for Streaming Servers and environments where RTSP is being used for communication.
