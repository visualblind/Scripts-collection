# Deploying MBAM 1.0 Group Policy Objects


To successfully deploy Microsoft BitLocker Administration and Monitoring (MBAM), you must first determine the Group Policies that you will use in your implementation of MBAM. For more information about the various available policies, see [Planning for MBAM 1.0 Group Policy Requirements](planning-for-mbam-10-group-policy-requirements.md). When you have determined the policies that you are going to use, you must use the MBAM 1.0 Group Policy template to create and deploy one or more Group Policy objects (GPO) that include the MBAM policy settings.

## Install the MBAM 1.0 Group Policy template


In addition to providing server-related features of MBAM, the server setup application includes an MBAM Group Policy template. You can install this template on any computer that is able to run the Group Policy Management Console (GPMC) or Advanced Group Policy Management (AGPM).

## Deploy MBAM 1.0 Group Policy settings


After you create the necessary GPOs, you must deploy the MBAM Group Policy settings to your organization’s client computers.

## Display the MBAM Control Panel in Windows


Because MBAM offers a customized MBAM control panel that can replace the default Windows BitLocker control panel, you can also choose to hide the default BitLocker Control Panel from end users by using Group Policy.
