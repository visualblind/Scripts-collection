# Fixing Applications by Using the SUA Tool


**Applies to**

-   Windows 10
-   Windows 8.1
-   Windows 8
-   Windows 7
-   Windows Server 2012
-   Windows Server 2008 R2

On the user interface for the Standard User Analyzer (SUA) tool, you can apply fixes to an application.

**To fix an application by using the SUA tool**

1.  Use the SUA tool to test an application. For more information, see [Using the SUA Tool](using-the-sua-tool.md).

2.  After you finish testing, open the SUA tool.

3.  On the **Mitigation** menu, click the command that corresponds to the action that you want to take. The following table describes the commands.

    <table>
    <colgroup>
    <col width="50%" />
    <col width="50%" />
    </colgroup>
    <thead>
    <tr class="header">
    <th align="left">Mitigation menu command</th>
    <th align="left">Description</th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr class="odd">
    <td align="left"><p><strong>Apply Mitigations</strong></p></td>
    <td align="left"><p>Opens the <strong>Mitigate AppCompat Issues</strong> dialog box, in which you can select the fixes that you intend to apply to the application.</p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="even">
    <td align="left"><p><strong>Undo Mitigations</strong></p></td>
    <td align="left"><p>Removes the application fixes that you just applied.</p>
    <p>This option is available only after you apply an application fix and before you close the SUA tool. Alternatively, you can manually remove application fixes by using <strong>Programs and Features</strong> in Control Panel.</p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="odd">
    <td align="left"><p><strong>Export Mitigations as Windows Installer file</strong></p></td>
    <td align="left"><p>Exports your application fixes as a Windows® Installer (.msi) file, which can then be deployed to other computers that are running the application.</p></td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
    </table>
