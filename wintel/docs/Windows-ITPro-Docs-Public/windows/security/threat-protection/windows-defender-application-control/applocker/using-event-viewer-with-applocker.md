# Using Event Viewer with AppLocker

**Applies to**
- WindowsÂ 10
- Windows Server

This topic lists AppLocker events and describes how to use Event Viewer with AppLocker.

The AppLocker log contains information about applications that are affected by AppLocker rules. Each event in the log contains detailed info about:

-   Which file is affected and the path of that file
-   Which packaged app is affected and the package identifier of the app
-   Whether the file or packaged app is allowed or blocked
-   The rule type (path, file hash, or publisher)
-   The rule name
-   The security identifier (SID) for the user or group identified in the rule

Review the entries in the Event Viewer to determine if any applications are not included in the rules that you automatically generated. For instance, some line-of-business apps are installed to non-standard locations, such as the root of the active drive (for example: %SystemDrive%).

For info about what to look for in the AppLocker event logs, see [Monitor app usage with AppLocker](monitor-application-usage-with-applocker.md).

**To review the AppLocker log in Event Viewer**

1.  Open Event Viewer.
2.  In the console tree under **Application and Services Logs\\Microsoft\\Windows**, click **AppLocker**.
