# Use Windows PowerShell to manage group policy

Windows PowerShell supports group policy automation of the same tasks you perform in Group Policy Management Console (GPMC) for domain-based group policy objects (GPOs):

- Maintain GPOs (GPO creation, removal, backup, and import)
- Associate GPOs with Active Directory service containers (group policy link creation, update, and removal)
- Set permissions on GPOs
- Modify inheritance flags on Active Directory organization units (OUs) and domains
- Configure registry-based policy settings and group policy preferences registry settings (update, retrieval, and removal)
- Create starter GPOs
