# Performance Guidance for Application Virtualization 5.1


Learn how to configure App-V 5.1 for optimal performance, optimize virtual app packages, and provide a better user experience with RDS and VDI.

Implementing multiple methods can help you improve the end-user experience. However, your environment may not support all methods.

You should read and understand the following information before reading this document.

-   [Microsoft Application Virtualization 5.1 Administrator's Guide](microsoft-application-virtualization-51-administrators-guide.md)

-   [App-V 5 SP2 Application Publishing and Client Interaction](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=395206)

-   [Microsoft Application Virtualization Sequencing Guide](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=269953)

**Note**  
Some terms used in this document may have different meanings depending on external source and context. For more information about terms used in this document followed by an asterisk **\\*** review the [Application Virtualization Performance Guidance Terminology](#bkmk-terms1) section of this document.



Finally, this document will provide you with the information to configure the computer running App-V 5.1 client and the environment for optimal performance. Optimize your virtual application packages for performance using the sequencer, and to understand how to use User Experience Virtualization (UE-V) or other user environment management technologies to provide the optimal user experience with App-V 5.1 in both Remote Desktop Services (RDS) and non-persistent virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI).

To help determine what information is relevant to your environment you should review each section’s brief overview and applicability checklist.

This section provides information about an approach that helps ensure a user will have access to all virtual applications within seconds after logging in. This is achieved by uniquely addressing the often long-running App-V 5.1 publishing refresh. As you will discover the basis of the approach, the fastest publishing refresh, is one that doesn’t have to actually do anything. A number of conditions must be met and steps followed to provide the optimal user experience.

Use the information in the following section for more information:

[Usage Scenarios](#bkmk-us) - As you review the two scenarios, keep in mind that these are the approach extremes. Based on your usage requirements, you may choose to apply these steps to a subset of users and/or virtual applications packages.

-   Optimized for Performance – To provide the optimal experience, you can expect the base image to include some of the App-V virtual application package. This and other requirements are discussed.

-   Optimized for Storage – If you are concerned with the storage impact, following this scenario will help address those concerns.

[Preparing your Environment](#bkmk-pe)

-   Steps to Prepare the Base Image – Whether in a non-persistent VDI or RDSH environment, only a few steps must be completed in the base image to enable this approach.

-   Use UE-V 2.1 as the User Profile Management (UPM) solution for the App-V approach – the cornerstone of this approach is the ability of a UEM solution to persist the contents of just a few registry and file locations. These locations constitute the user integrations\*. Be sure to review the specific requirements for the UPM solution.

[User Experience Walk-through](#bkmk-uewt)

-   Walk-through – This is a step-by-step walk-through of the App-V and UE-V operations and the expectations users should have.

-   Outcome – This describes the expected results.

### Configure UE-V solution for App-V Approach

We recommend using Microsoft User Experience Virtualization (UE-V) to capture and centralize application settings and Windows operating system settings for a specific user. These settings are then applied to the different computers that are accessed by the user, including desktop computers, laptop computers, and virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) sessions. UE-V is optimized for RDS and VDI scenarios.

For more information see [Getting Started With User Experience Virtualization 2.0](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dn458926.aspx)

In essence all that is required is to install the UE-V client and download the following Microsoft authored App-V settings template from the [Microsoft User Experience Virtualization (UE-V) template gallery](https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/Authored-UE-V-Settings-bb442a33). Register the template. For more information around UE-V templates see [The UE-V specific resource for acquiring and registering the template](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dn458926.aspx).

**Note**  
Without performing an additional configuration step, the Microsoft User Environment Virtualization (UE-V) will not be able to synchronize the Start menu shortcuts (.lnk files) on the target computer. The .lnk file type is excluded by default.

UE-V will only support removing the .lnk file type from the exclusion list in the RDS and VDI scenarios, where every user’s device will have the same set of applications installed to the same location and every .lnk file is valid for all the users’ devices. For example, UE-V would not currently support the following 2 scenarios, because the net result will be that the shortcut will be valid on one but not all devices.

-   If a user has an application installed on one device with .lnk files enabled and the same native application installed on another device to a different installation root with .lnk files enabled.

-   If a user has an application installed on one device but not another with .lnk files enabled.



**Important**  
This topic describes how to change the Windows registry by using Registry Editor. If you change the Windows registry incorrectly, you can cause serious problems that might require you to reinstall Windows. You should make a backup copy of the registry files (System.dat and User.dat) before you change the registry. Microsoft cannot guarantee that the problems that might occur when you change the registry can be resolved. Change the registry at your own risk.



Using the Microsoft Registry Editor (regedit.exe), navigate to **HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE** \\ **Software** \\ **Microsoft** \\ **UEV** \\ **Agent** \\ **Configuration** \\ **ExcludedFileTypes** and remove **.lnk** from the excluded file types.

**Configure other User Profile Management (UPM) solution for App-V Approach**

The expectation in a stateful environment is that a UPM solution is implemented and can support persistence of user data across sessions and between logins.

The requirements for the UPM solution are as follows.

To enable an optimized login experience, for example the App-V 5.1 approach for the user, the solution must be capable of:

-   Persisting the below user integrations as part of the user profile/persona.

-   Triggering a user profile sync on login (or application start), which can guarantee that all user integrations are applied before publishing/refresh begin, or,

-   Attaching and detaching a user profile disk (UPD) or similar technology that contains the user integrations.

    **Note**  
    App-V is supported when using UPD only when the entire profile is stored on the user profile disk.

    App-V packages are not supported when using UPD with selected folders stored in the user profile disk. The Copy on Write driver does not handle UPD selected folders.



-   Capturing changes to the locations, which constitute the user integrations, prior to session logoff.

With App-V 5.1 when you add a publishing server (**Add-AppvPublishingServer**) you can configure synchronization, for example refresh during log on and/or after a specified refresh interval. In both cases a scheduled task is created.

In previous versions of App-V 5.1, both scheduled tasks were configured using a VBScript that would initiate the user and global refresh. With Hotfix Package 4 for Application Virtualization 5.0 SP2 the user refresh on log on was initiated by **SyncAppvPublishingServer.exe**. This change was introduced to provide UPM solutions a trigger process. This process delays the publish /refresh to allow the UPM solution to apply the user integrations. It will exit once the publishing/refresh is complete.

**User Integrations**

Registry – HKEY\_CURRENT\_USER

-   Path - Software\\Classes

    Exclude: Local Settings, ActivatableClasses, AppX\*

-   Path - Software\\Microsoft\\AppV

-   Path- Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\App Paths

**File Locations**

-   Root – “Environment Variable” APPDATA

    Path – Microsoft\\AppV\\Client\\Catalog

-   Root – “Environment Variable” APPDATA

    Path – Microsoft\\AppV\\Client\\Integration

-   Root – “Environment Variable” APPDATA

    Path - Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu\\Programs

-   (To persist all desktop shortcuts, virtual and non-virtual)

    Root - “KnownFolder” {B4BFCC3A-DB2C-424C-B029-7FE99A87C641}FileMask - \*.lnk

**Microsoft User Experience Virtualization (UE-V)**

Additionally, we recommend using Microsoft User Experience Virtualization (UE-V) to capture and centralize application settings and Windows operating system settings for a specific user. These settings are then applied to the different computers that are accessed by the user, including desktop computers, laptop computers, and virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) sessions.

For more information see [Getting Started With User Experience Virtualization 1.0](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/jj680015.aspx) and [Sharing Settings Location Templates with the UE-V Template Gallery](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/jj679972.aspx).

### <a href="" id="bkmk-plc"></a>Impact to Package Life Cycle

Upgrading a package is a crucial aspect of the package lifecycle. To help guarantee users have access to the appropriate upgraded (published) or downgraded (un-published) virtual application packages, it is recommended you update the base image to reflect these changes. To understand why review the following section:

App-V 5.0 SP2 introduced the concept of pending states. In the past,

-   If an administrator changed entitlements or created a new version of a package (upgraded) and during a publishing/refresh that package was in-use, the un-publish or publish operation, respectively, would fail.

-   Now, if a package is in-use the operation will be pended. The un-publish and publish-pend operations will be processed on service restart or if another publish or un-publish command is issued. In the latter case, if the virtual application is in-use otherwise, the virtual application will remain in a pending state. For globally published packages, a restart (or service restart) often needed.

In a non-persistent environment, it is unlikely these pended operations will be processed. The pended operations, for example tasks are captured under **HKEY\_CURRENT\_USER** \\ **Software** \\ **Microsoft** \\ **AppV** \\ **Client** \\ **PendingTasks**. Although this location is persisted by the UPM solution, if it is not applied to the environment prior to log on, it will not be processed.

### Removing FB1

Removing FB1 does not require the original application installer. After completing the following steps, it is suggested that you revert the computer running the sequencer to a clean snapshot.

**Sequencer UI** - Create a New Virtual Application Package.

### Creating a new virtual application package on the sequencer

If, during sequencer monitoring, an SxS Assembly (such as a VC++ Runtime) is installed as part of an application’s installation, SxS Assembly will be automatically detected and included in the package. The administrator will be notified and will have the option to exclude the SxS Assembly.

**Client Side**:

When publishing a virtual application package, the App-V Client will detect if a required SxS dependency is already installed. If the dependency is unavailable on the computer and it is included in the package, a traditional Windows Installer (.**msi**) installation of the SxS assembly will be initiated. As previously documented, simply install the dependency on the computer running the client to ensure that the Windows Installer (.msi) installation will not occur.

### Disabling a Dynamic Configuration using Powershell

-   For already published packages, you can use `Set-AppVClientPackage –Name Myapp –Path c:\Packages\Apps\MyApp.appv` without

    **-DynamicDeploymentConfiguration** parameter

-   Similarly, when adding new packages using `Add-AppVClientPackage –Path c:\Packages\Apps\MyApp.appv`, do not use the

    **-DynamicDeploymentConfiguration** parameter.

For documentation on How to Apply a Dynamic Configuration, see:

### Determining what virtual fonts exist in the package

-   Make a copy of the package.

-   Rename Package\_copy.appv to Package\_copy.zip

-   Open AppxManifest.xml and locate the following:

    &lt;appv:Extension Category="AppV.Fonts"&gt;

    &lt;appv:Fonts&gt;

    &lt;appv:Font Path="\[{Fonts}\]\\private\\CalibriL.ttf" DelayLoad="true"&gt;&lt;/appv:Font&gt;

    **Note**  
    If there are fonts marked as **DelayLoad**, those will not impact first launch.



~~~
&lt;/appv:Fonts&gt;
~~~

### Excluding virtual fonts from the package

Use the dynamic configuration file that best suits the user scope – deployment configuration for all users on computer, user configuration for specific user or users.

-   Disable fonts with the deployment or user configuration.

&lt;Fonts Enabled="false" /&gt;

## <a href="" id="bkmk-terms1"></a> App-V 5.1 Performance Guidance Terminology


The following terms are used when describing concepts and actions related to App-V 5.1 performance optimization.

-   **Complexity** – Refers to the one or more package characteristics that may impact performance during pre-configure (**Add-AppvClientPackage**) or integration (**Publish-AppvClientPackage**). Some example characteristics are: manifest size, number of virtual fonts, number of files.

-   **De-Integrate** – Removes the user integrations

-   **Re-Integrate** – Applies the user integrations.

-   **Non-Persistent, Pooled** – Creates a computer running a virtual environment each time they log in.

-   **Persistent, Personal** – A computer running a virtual environment that remains the same for every login.

-   **Stateful** - For this document, implies that user integrations are persisted between sessions and a user environment management technology is used in conjunction with non-persistent RDSH or VDI.

-   **Stateless** – Represents a scenario when no user state is persisted between sessions.

-   **Trigger** – (or Native Action Triggers). UPM uses these types of triggers to initiate monitoring or synchronization operations.

-   **User Experience** - In the context of App-V 5.1, the user experience, quantitatively, is the sum of the following parts:

    -   From the point that users initiate a log-in to when they are able to manipulate the desktop.

    -   From the point where the desktop can be interacted with to the point a publishing refresh begins (in PowerShell terms, sync) when using the App-V 5.1 full server infrastructure. In standalone instances, it is when the **Add-AppVClientPackage** and **Publish-AppVClientPackage Powershell** commands are initiated.

    -   From start to completion of the publishing refresh. In standalone instances, this is the first to last virtual application published.

    -   From the point where the virtual application is available to launch from a shortcut. Alternatively, it is from the point at which the file type association is registered and will launch a specified virtual application.

-   **User Profile Management** – The controlled and structured approach to managing user components associated with the environment. For example, user profiles, preference and policy management, application control and application deployment. You can use scripting or third-party solutions configure the environment as needed.
