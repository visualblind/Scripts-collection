# Creating or Controlling a GPO


To use Advanced Group Policy Management (AGPM) to provide change control for a Group Policy Object (GPO), you must first control the GPO with AGPM. New GPOs created through the **Change Control** folder will automatically be controlled.

-   [Control an Uncontrolled GPO](control-an-uncontrolled-gpo-agpm40.md)

-   [Create a New Controlled GPO](create-a-new-controlled-gpo-agpm40.md)

-   [Delegate Management of a Controlled GPO](delegate-management-of-a-controlled-gpo-agpm40.md)

-   [Import a GPO from Production](import-a-gpo-from-production-agpm40-app.md)
