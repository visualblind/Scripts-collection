# Before you start using IEAK 11

Before you run IEAK 11 and the Customization Wizard, make sure you have met the following requirements:

- Have you determined which licensing version of the Internet Explorer Administration Kit 11 to install? For info, see [Determine the licensing version and features to use in IEAK 11](licensing-version-and-features-ieak11.md).

-   Do you meet the necessary hardware and software requirements? See [Hardware and software requirements for IEAK 11](hardware-and-software-reqs-ieak11.md).

-   Have you gotten all of the URLs needed to customize your **Home**, **Search**, and **Support** pages? See [Use the Important URLs - Home Page and Support page in the IEAK 11 Wizard](important-urls-home-page-and-support-ieak11-wizard.md).

-   Have you reviewed the security features to determine how to set up and manage them? See [Security features and IEAK 11](security-and-ieak11.md).

-   Have you created a test lab, where you can run the test version of your browser package to make sure it runs properly?
