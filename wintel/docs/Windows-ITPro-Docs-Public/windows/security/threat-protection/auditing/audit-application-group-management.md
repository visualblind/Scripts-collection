# Audit Application Group Management

**Applies to**
-   Windows 10
-   Windows Server 2016

Audit Application Group Management generates events for actions related to [application groups](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/cc771579.aspx), such as group creation, modification, addition or removal of group member and some other actions.

[Application groups](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/cc771579.aspx) are used by [Authorization Manager](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/cc726036.aspx).

Audit Application Group Management subcategory is out of scope of this document, because [Authorization Manager](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/cc726036.aspx) is very rarely in use and it is deprecated starting from Windows Server 2012.
