# How to Validate the MBAM Installation with Configuration Manager


After installing Microsoft BitLocker Administration and Monitoring (MBAM) with Configuration Manager, validate that the installation has successfully set up all the necessary features for MBAM by completing the following steps.

**To validate the MBAM Server feature installation with Configuration Manager**

1.  On the server where System Center Configuration Manager is deployed, open **Control Panel**. Select the program that is used to uninstall or change a program. Verify that **Microsoft BitLocker Administration and Monitoring** appears in the list of programs and features.

    **Note**  
    To validate the installation, you must use a domain account that has local computer administrative credentials on each server.

     

2.  Use the Configuration Manager console to confirm that a new collection, called “MBAM Supported Computers,” is displayed.

    To view the collection with Configuration Manager 2007: Click **Site Database** (&lt;**SiteCode**&gt; - &lt;**ServerName**&gt;, &lt;**SiteName**&gt;), **Computer Management**.

    To view the reports with System Center 2012 Configuration Manager: Click the **Monitoring** workspace, **Reporting**, **Reports**.
