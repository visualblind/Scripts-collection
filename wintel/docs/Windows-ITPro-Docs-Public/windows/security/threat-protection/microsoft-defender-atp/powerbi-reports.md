Understand the security status of your organization, including the status of machines, alerts, and investigations using the Microsoft Defender ATP reporting feature that integrates with Power BI. 

Microsoft Defender ATP supports the use of Power BI data connectors to enable you to connect and access Microsoft Defender ATP data using Microsoft Graph.

Data connectors integrate seamlessly in Power BI, and make it easy for power users to query, shape and combine data to build reports and dashboards that meet the needs of your organization. 

You can easily get started by:
- Creating a dashboard on the Power BI service 
- Building a custom dashboard on Power BI Desktop and tweaking it to fit the visual analytics and reporting requirements of your organization 

You can access these options from Microsoft Defender Security Center. Both the Power BI service and Power BI Desktop are supported.

Microsoft Defender ATP makes it easy to create a Power BI dashboard by providing an option straight from the portal. 

1. In the navigation pane, select **Settings** > **General** > **Power BI reports**.

## Using the Power BI reports
There are a couple of tabs on the report that's generated:

- Machine and alerts 
- Investigation results and action center
- Secure Score

In general, if you know of a specific threat name, CVE, or KB, you can identify machines with unpatched vulnerabilities that might be leveraged by threats. This report also helps you determine whether machine-level mitigations are configured correctly on the machines and prioritize those that might need attention.
