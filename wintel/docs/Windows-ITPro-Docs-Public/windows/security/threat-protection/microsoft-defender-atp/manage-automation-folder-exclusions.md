Automation folder exclusions allow you to specify folders that the Automated investigation will skip. 

You can control the following attributes about the folder that you'd like to be skipped:
- Folders 
- Extensions of the files
- File names


**Folders**<br>
You can specify a folder and its subfolders to be skipped. 


>[!NOTE]
>At this time, use of wild cards as a way to exclude files under a directory is not yet supported. 


**Extensions**<br>
You can specify the extensions to exclude in a specific directory. The extensions are a way to prevent an attacker from using an excluded folder to hide an exploit. The extensions explicitly define which files to ignore. 

**File names**<br>
You can specify the file names that you want to be excluded in a specific directory. The names are a way to prevent an attacker from using an excluded folder to hide an exploit. The names explicitly define which files to ignore.
