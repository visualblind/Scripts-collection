## Enrollment guidelines

Welcome to Olympia Corp. Here are the steps needed to enroll.

As part of Windows Insider Lab for Enterprise, you can upgrade to Windows 10 Enterprise from Windows 10 Pro. This upgrade is optional. Since certain features such as Windows Defender Application Guard are only available on Windows 10 Enterprise, we recommend you to upgrade.

Choose one of the following two enrollment options:

- To set up an AAD-registered device, [follow these steps](#enrollment-keep-current-edition). In this case, you log onto the device by using an existing (non-Olympia) account.

- If you are running Windows 10 Pro, we recommend that you upgrade to Windows 10 Enterprise by following these steps to  [set up an Azure Active Directory-joined device](#enrollment-upgrade-to-enterprise). In this case, you will be able to log on to the device with your Olympia account.
