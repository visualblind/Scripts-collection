## Sequencing error detection


The App-V 5.0 sequencer can detect common sequencing issues during sequencing. The **Installation Report** page at the end of the sequencing wizard displays diagnostic messages categorized into **Errors**, **Warnings**, and **Info** depending on the severity of the issue.

To display more detailed information about an event, double-click the item you want to review in the report. The sequencing issues, as well as suggestions about how to resolve the issues are displayed. Information from the system preparation report and the installation report are summarized when you have finished creating a package. The following list displays the types of issues available in the report:

-   Excluded files.

-   Driver information.

-   COM+ system differences.

-   Side-by-side (SxS) conflicts.

-   Shell Extensions.

-   Information about unsupported services.

-   DCOM.

## Connection Groups


The App-V feature formerly known as **Dynamic Suite Composition** is now referred to as **Connection Groups** in App-V 5.0. For more information about using Connection Groups see [Managing Connection Groups](managing-connection-groups.md).

## Licensing and Metering Functionality


The application and licensing functionality has been removed in App-V 5.0. The actual license positions in your environment depend on the specific software title license and usage rights granted by the associated license terms.

## File and Application Cache


There is no file or application cache available with App-V 5.0.
