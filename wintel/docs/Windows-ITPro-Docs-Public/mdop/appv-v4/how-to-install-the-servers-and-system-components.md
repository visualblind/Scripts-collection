# How to Install the Servers and System Components


Before you can deliver applications to users, you must install the Microsoft Application Virtualization Platform components. The topics in this section provide the information required to install the Application Virtualization Servers and the other Application Virtualization System components.

**Note**  
The procedures in this section take you through a customized installation, where you pick and choose components to install on separate computers, as recommended in a production environment. However, your operating procedures might dictate a different approach, and during the installation process you might want to group components together. Regardless of where you install the components, you can install them in any order.
