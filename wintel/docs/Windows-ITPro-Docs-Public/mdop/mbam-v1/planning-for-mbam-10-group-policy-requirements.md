# Planning for MBAM 1.0 Group Policy Requirements


Microsoft BitLocker Administration and Monitoring (MBAM) Client management requires custom Group Policy settings to be applied. This topic describes the available policy options for Group Policy Object (GPO) when you use MBAM to manage BitLocker Drive Encryption in the enterprise.

**Important**  
MBAM does not use the default GPO settings for Windows BitLocker drive encryption. If the default settings are enabled, they can cause conflicting behavior. To enable MBAM to manage BitLocker, you must define the GPO policy settings after you install the MBAM Group Policy Template.



After you install the MBAM Group Policy template, you can view and modify the available custom MBAM GPO policy settings that enable MBAM to manage the enterprise BitLocker encryption. The MBAM Group Policy template must be installed on a computer that is capable of running the Group Policy Management Console (GPMC) or the Advanced Group Policy Management (AGPM) MDOP technology. Next, to edit the applicable GPO, open the GPMC or AGPM, and then navigate to the following GPO node: **Computer Configuration**\\**Administrative Templates**\\**Windows Components**\\**MDOP MBAM (BitLocker Management)**.

The MDOP MBAM (BitLocker Management) GPO node contains four global policy settings and four child GPO setting nodes, respectively. The four GPO global policy settings are: Client Management, Fixed Drive, Operating System Drive, and Removable Drive. The following sections provide policy definitions and suggested policy settings to help you plan for the MBAM GPO policy setting requirements.

**Note**  
For more information about configuring the minimum suggested GPO settings to enable MBAM to manage BitLocker encryption, see [How to Edit MBAM 1.0 GPO Settings](how-to-edit-mbam-10-gpo-settings.md).



## Global policy definitions


This section describes the MBAM Global policy definitions, which can be found at the following GPO node: **Computer Configuration**\\**Administrative Templates**\\**Windows Components**\\**MDOP MBAM (BitLocker Management)**.

## Client Management policy definitions


This section describes the Client Management policy definitions for MBAM, found at the following GPO node: **Computer Configuration**\\**Administrative Templates**\\**Windows Components**\\**MDOP MBAM (BitLocker Management)** \\ **Client Management**.

<td align="left"><p>Configure MBAM Services</p></td>
<td align="left"><p>Suggested Configuration: <strong>Enabled</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>MBAM Recovery and Hardware service endpoint</strong>. This is the first policy setting that you must configure to enable the MBAM Client BitLocker encryption management. For this setting, enter the endpoint location similar to the following example: <strong>http://</strong><em>&lt;MBAM Administration and Monitoring Server Name&gt;</em><strong>:</strong><em>&lt;port the web service is bound to&gt;</em><strong>/MBAMRecoveryAndHardwareService/CoreService.svc</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Select BitLocker recovery information to store</strong>. This policy setting lets you configure the key recovery service to back up the BitLocker recovery information. It also lets you configure the status reporting service for collecting compliance and audit reports. The policy provides an administrative method of recovering data encrypted by BitLocker to help prevent data loss due to the lack of key information. Status report and key recovery activity will automatically and silently be sent to the configured report server location.</p>
<p>If you do not configure or if you disable this policy setting, the key recovery information will not be saved, and status report and key recovery activity will not be reported to server. When this setting is set to <strong>Recovery Password and key package</strong>, the recovery password and key package will be automatically and silently backed up to the configured key recovery server location.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Enter the client checking status frequency in minutes</strong>. This policy setting manages how frequently the client checks the BitLocker protection policies and the status on the client computer. This policy also manages how frequently the client compliance status is saved to the server. The client checks the BitLocker protection policies and status on the client computer, and it also backs up the client recovery key at the configured frequency.</p>
<p>Set this frequency based on the requirement established by your company on how frequently to check the compliance status of the computer, and how frequently to back up the client recovery key.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>MBAM Status reporting service endpoint</strong>. This is the second policy setting that you must configure to enable MBAM Client BitLocker encryption management. For this setting, enter the endpoint location by using the following example: <strong>http://</strong><em>&lt;MBAM Administration and Monitoring Server Name&gt;</em><strong>:</strong><em>&lt;port the web service is bound to&gt;</em><strong>/MBAMComplianceStatusService/StatusReportingService. svc</strong>.</p></li>
</ul></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td align="left"><p>Allow hardware compatibility checking</p></td>
<td align="left"><p>Suggested Configuration: <strong>Enabled</strong></p>
<p>This policy setting lets you manage the verification of hardware compatibility before you enable BitLocker protection on drives of MBAM client computers.</p>
<p>You should enable this policy option if your enterprise has older computer hardware or computers that do not support Trusted Platform Module (TPM). If either of these criteria is true, enable the hardware compatibility verification to make sure that MBAM is applied only to computer models that support BitLocker. If all computers in your organization support BitLocker, you do not have to deploy the Hardware Compatibility, and you can set this policy to <strong>Not Configured</strong>.</p>
<p>If you enable this policy setting, the model of the computer is validated against the hardware compatibility list once every 24 hours, before the policy enables BitLocker protection on a computer drive.</p>
<div class="alert">
<strong>Note</strong><br/><p>Before enabling this policy setting, make sure that you have configured the <strong>MBAM Recovery and Hardware service endpoint</strong> setting in the <strong>Configure MBAM Services</strong> policy options.</p>

<td align="left"><p>Suggested Configuration: <strong>Not Configured</strong></p>
<p>This policy setting lets you configure a web site address, email address, or phone number that will instruct a user to request an exemption from BitLocker encryption.</p>
<p>If you enable this policy setting and provide a web site address, email address, or phone number, users will see a dialog with instructions on how to apply for an exemption from BitLocker protection. For more information about how to enable BitLocker encryption exemptions for users, see <a href="how-to-manage-user-bitlocker-encryption-exemptions-mbam-1.md" data-raw-source="[How to Manage User BitLocker Encryption Exemptions](how-to-manage-user-bitlocker-encryption-exemptions-mbam-1.md)">How to Manage User BitLocker Encryption Exemptions</a>.</p>
<p>If you either disable or do not configure this policy setting, the instructions about how to apply for an exemption request will not be presented to users.</p>
<div class="alert">
<strong>Note</strong><br/><p>User exemption is managed per user, not per computer. If multiple users log on to the same computer and one user is not exempt, the computer will be encrypted.</p>

<li><p>Configure PIN usage to use a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) PIN for operating system protection.</p></li>
<li><p>Configure enhanced startup PINs to permit characters such as uppercase and lowercase letters, and numbers. MBAM does not support the use of symbols and spaces for enhanced PINs, even though BitLocker supports symbols and spaces.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If you enable this policy setting, users are required to secure the operating system drive by using BitLocker.</p>
<p>If you do not configure or if you disable the setting, users are not required to secure the operating system drive by using BitLocker.</p>
<p>If you disable this policy, the MBAM agent decrypts the operating system volume if it is encrypted.</p>
<p>When it is enabled, this policy setting requires users to secure the operating system by using BitLocker protection, and the drive is encrypted. Based on your encryption requirements, you may select the method of protection for the operating system drive.</p>
<p>For higher security requirements, use TPM + PIN, allow enhanced PINs, and set the minimum PIN length to eight characters.</p>
<p>When this policy is enabled with the TPM + PIN protector, you can consider disabling the following policies under <strong>System</strong> / <strong>Power Management</strong> / <strong>Sleep Settings</strong>:</p>
<ul>
