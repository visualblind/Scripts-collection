# Manage updates for mobile devices and virtual machines (VMs)

**Applies to:**

- [Microsoft Defender Advanced Threat Protection (Microsoft Defender ATP)](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2069559)

Mobile devices and VMs may require additional configuration to ensure performance is not impacted by updates.

There are two settings that are particularly useful for these devices:

- Opt-in to Microsoft Update on mobile computers without a WSUS connection
- Prevent Security intelligence updates when running on battery power

The following topics may also be useful in these situations:

- [Manage updates for endpoints that are out of date](manage-outdated-endpoints-windows-defender-antivirus.md)
- [Deployment guide for Windows Defender Antivirus in a virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) environment](deployment-vdi-windows-defender-antivirus.md)

## Opt-in to Microsoft Update on mobile computers without a WSUS connection

You can use Microsoft Update to keep Security intelligence on mobile devices running Windows Defender Antivirus up to date when they are not connected to the corporate network or don't otherwise have a WSUS connection. 

This means that protection updates can be delivered to devices (via Microsoft Update) even if you have set WSUS to override Microsoft Update.

You can opt-in to Microsoft Update on the mobile device in one of the following ways:

1. Change the setting with Group Policy
2. Use a VBScript to create a script, then run it on each computer in your network.
3. Manually opt-in every computer on your network through the **Settings** menu.

**Use Group Policy to opt-in to Microsoft Update:**

1.  On your Group Policy management machine, open the [Group Policy Management Console](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/cc731212.aspx), right-click the Group Policy Object you want to configure and click **Edit**.

3.  In the **Group Policy Management Editor** go to **Computer configuration**.

4.  Click **Policies** then **Administrative templates**.

5.  Expand the tree to **Windows components > Windows Defender Antivirus > Signature Updates**.

6.  Double-click the **Allow security intelligence updates from Microsoft Update** setting and set the option to **Enabled**. Click **OK**.


**Use a VBScript to opt-in to Microsoft Update**

1.  Use the instructions in the MSDN article [Opt-In to Microsoft Update](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/aa826676.aspx) to create the VBScript.
2.  Run the VBScript you created on each computer in your network.


**Manually opt-in to Microsoft Update**

1.  Open **Windows Update** in **Update & security** settings on the computer you want to opt-in.
2.  Click **Advanced** options.
3.  Select the checkbox for **Give me updates for other Microsoft products when I update Windows**.

## Prevent Security intelligence updates when running on battery power

You can configure Windows Defender Antivirus to only download protection updates when the PC is connected to a wired power source. 

**Use Group Policy to prevent security intelligence updates on battery power:**

1.  On your Group Policy management machine, open the [Group Policy Management Console](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/cc731212.aspx), right-click the Group Policy Object you want to configure and click **Edit**.

3.  In the **Group Policy Management Editor** go to **Computer configuration**.

4.  Click **Policies** then **Administrative templates**.

5.  Expand the tree to **Windows components > Windows Defender Antivirus > Signature Updates** and configure the following setting:

    1. Double-click the **Allow security intelligence updates when running on battery power** setting and set the option to **Disabled**. 
    2. Click **OK**. This will prevent protection updates from downloading when the PC is on battery power.
