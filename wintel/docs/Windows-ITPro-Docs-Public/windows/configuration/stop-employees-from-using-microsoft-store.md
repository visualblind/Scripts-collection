IT pros can configure access to Microsoft Store for client computers in their organization. For some organizations, business policies require blocking access to Microsoft Store.

> [!Important]
> All executable code including Microsoft Store applications should have an update and maintenance plan.  Organizations that use Microsoft Store applications should ensure that the applications can be updated through the Microsoft Store over the internet, through the [Private Store](/microsoft-store/distribute-apps-from-your-private-store), or [distributed offline](/microsoft-store/distribute-offline-apps) to keep the applications up to date.

## Options to configure access to Microsoft Store


You can use these tools to configure access to Microsoft Store: AppLocker or Group Policy. For Windows 10, this is only supported on Windows 10 Enterprise edition.

## <a href="" id="block-store-mdm"></a>Block Microsoft Store using management tool


Applies to: Windows 10 Mobile

If you have mobile devices in your organization that you upgraded from earlier versions of Windows Phone 8 to Windows 10 Mobile, existing policies created using the Windows Phone 8.1 configuration service providers (CSP) with your MDM tool will continue to work on Windows 10 Mobile. If you are starting with Windows 10 Mobile, we recommend using [AppLocker](#block-store-applocker) to manage access to Microsoft Store app.

When your MDM tool supports Microsoft Store for Business, the MDM can use these CSPs to block Microsoft Store app:

-   [Policy](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=717030)

-   [EnterpriseAssignedAccess](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/mt157024.aspx) (Windows 10 Mobile, only)

For more information, see [Configure an MDM provider](/microsoft-store/configure-mdm-provider-windows-store-for-business).

## Show private store only using Group Policy 
Applies to Windows 10 Enterprise, version 1607, Windows 10 Education

If you're using Microsoft Store for Business and you want employees to only see apps you're managing in your private store, you can use Group Policy to show only the private store. Microsoft Store app will still be available, but employees can't view or purchase apps. Employees can view and install apps that the admin has added to your organization's private store. 

**To show private store only in Microsoft Store app**

1. Type **gpedit** in the search bar, and then select **Edit group policy (Control panel)** to find and start Group Policy Editor.

2. In the console tree of the snap-in, go to **User Configuration** or **Computer Configuration** > **Administrative Templates** > **Windows Components**, and then click **Store**.

3. Right-click **Only display the private store within the Microsoft Store app** in the right pane, and click **Edit**.

    This opens the **Only display the private store within the Microsoft Store app** policy settings.

4. On the **Only display the private store within the Microsoft Store app** setting page, click **Enabled**, and then click **OK**.
