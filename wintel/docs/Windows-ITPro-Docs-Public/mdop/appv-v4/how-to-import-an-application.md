# How to Import an Application


You can use the following procedure to import an application into the cache directly from the **Results** pane of the **Application** node in the Application Virtualization Client Management Console.

**To import an application**

1.  Move the cursor to the **Results** pane, right-click the desired application, and select **Import** from the pop-up menu.

2.  From the **Browse** window, navigate to the location of the package file for the desired application, and then click **OK**.

    **Note**  
    If you have already configured an import search path or if the SFT file is in the same path as the last successful import, step 2 is not required.
