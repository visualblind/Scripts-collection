# Application Virtualization Sequencer Overview


The Microsoft Application Virtualization (App-V) Sequencer monitors and records all installation and setup processes for an application and creates the following files: **ICO**, **OSD**, **SFT**, and **SPRJ**. These files contain all the necessary information about an application so the application can run in a virtual environment.
