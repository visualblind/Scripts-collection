# The Kubernetes Demo

This demo consists of three demos. They were shown during the *Load Balancing Kubernetes Services with NGINX and NGINX Plus* talk at the **NGINX Conf 2016**.

The goal of the demos is to show when you need to use NGINX or NGINX Plus for load balancing services on Kubernetes. The demos cover external (ingress) load balancing: traffic originates outside of the Kubernetes cluster.

## Prerequisites

To be able to run the demos you must have a Kubernetes cluster. Additionally, for the third demo, you must have the NGINX Plus subscription. If you don't have one, you can sign up for a [free 30-day trial](https://www.nginx.com/free-trial-request/).

## The demos

All three demos show how to setup load balancing of a Kubernetes service.

1. **The first demo** shows how to use the built-in TCP/UDP load balancing.
1. **The second demo** utilizes the built-in HTTP load balancing (Ingress) with NGINX or NGINX Plus Ingress controller.
1. **The third demo** shows how to configure NGINX Plus without the Ingress controller.
