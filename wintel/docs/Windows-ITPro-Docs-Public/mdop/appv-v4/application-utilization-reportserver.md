# Application Utilization Report


Use the Application Utilization Report to track usage information for a specified application defined in the database. You can use this report to determine how heavily a specific application is used.

This report generates a graph that displays the total daily usage over time during the reporting period.

This report also lists the following information:

-   Number of sessions—Number of times an application was used

The Application Utilization Report also includes a summary of the total usage.

When you create a report, you specify the parameters that are used for collecting the data when the report is run.

Reports are not run automatically; you must run them explicitly to generate output data. The length of time it takes to run a report is determined by the amount of data collected in the data store.

After you run a report and the output is displayed in the Application Virtualization Server Management Console, you can export the report into the following formats:

-   Adobe Acrobat (PDF)

-   Microsoft Office Excel
