# Windows 10, version 1709, connection endpoints for non-Enterprise editions

 **Applies to**

- Windows 10 Home, version 1709
- Windows 10 Professional, version 1709
- Windows 10 Education, version 1709

In addition to the endpoints listed for [Windows 10 Enterprise](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/privacy/manage-connections-from-windows-operating-system-components-to-microsoft-services), the following endpoints are available on other editions of Windows 10, version 1709.

We used the following methodology to derive these network endpoints:

1. Set up the latest version of Windows 10 on a test virtual machine using the default settings.
2. Leave the devices running idle for a week (that is, a user is not interacting with the system/device).
3. Use globally accepted network protocol analyzer/capturing tools and log all background egress traffic.
4. Compile reports on traffic going to public IP addresses.
5.  The test virtual machine was logged in using a local account and was not joined to a domain or Azure Active Directory.
6.  All traffic was captured in our lab using a IPV4 network.  Therefore no IPV6 traffic is reported here. 

> [!NOTE]
> Microsoft uses global load balancers that can appear in network trace-routes. For example, an endpoint for *.akadns.net might be used to load balance requests to an Azure datacenter, which can change over time.
