[Search provider discovery](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-edge/dev-guide/browser/search-provider-discovery): Microsoft Edge follows the OpenSearch 1.1 specification to discover and use web search providers. When a user browses to a search service, the OpenSearch description is picked up and saved for later use. Users can then choose to add the search service to use in the Microsoft Edge address bar.
