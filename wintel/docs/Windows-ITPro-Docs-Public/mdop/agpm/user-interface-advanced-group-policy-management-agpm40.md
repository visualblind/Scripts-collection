# User Interface: Advanced Group Policy Management


Advanced Group Policy Management (AGPM) adds a **Change Control** folder to each domain displayed in the **Group Policy Management Console** (GPMC). In an environment where multiple domains are managed with the GPMC, each domain is listed under the **Domains** folder in the console tree. Each domain has a **Change Control** folder under it, and there is one archive of Group Policy Objects (GPOs) per domain.

Within the details pane there are four primary tabs, providing access to both GPO-level settings and domain-level settings and commands for AGPM. Additionally, there are Administrative template settings specific to AGPM.

-   [Contents Tab](contents-tab-agpm40.md): GPO settings and commands and GPO-level delegation

-   [Domain Delegation Tab](domain-delegation-tab-agpm40.md): AGPM e-mail notification settings and domain-level delegation

-   [AGPM Server Tab](agpm-server-tab-agpm40.md): Domain-level archive connection settings

-   [Production Delegation Tab](production-delegation-tab-agpm40.md): Production environment delegation

-   [Administrative Templates Folder](administrative-templates-folder-agpm40.md): Central configuration of logging and tracking, archive locations, and the visibility of features
