[Advanced hunting](advanced-hunting-overview.md) queries can be shared among users in the same organization. You can also find queries shared publicly on GitHub. These queries let you quickly pursue specific threat hunting scenarios without having to write queries from scratch.

## Save, modify, and share a query
You can save a new or existing query so that it is only accessible to you or shared with other users in your organization.

1. Type a new query or load an existing one from under **Shared queries** or **My queries**.

2. Select **Save** or **Save as** from the save options. To avoid overwriting an existing query, choose **Save as**.

3. Enter a name for the query.

    - **My queries** — accessible only to you
    
5. Select **Save**.

## Delete or rename a query

## Access queries in the GitHub repository  
Microsoft security researchers regularly share Advanced hunting queries in a [designated public repository on GitHub](https://github.com/Microsoft/WindowsDefenderATP-Hunting-Queries). This repository is open to contributions. To contribute, [join GitHub for free](https://github.com/). 

>[!TIP]
>Microsoft security researchers also provide Advanced hunting queries that you can use to locate activities and indicators associated with emerging threats. These queries are provided as part of the [threat analytics](threat-analytics.md) reports in Microsoft Defender Security Center.
