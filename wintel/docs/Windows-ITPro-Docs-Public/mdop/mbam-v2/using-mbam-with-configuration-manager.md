# Using MBAM with Configuration Manager


When you install Microsoft BitLocker Administration and Monitoring (MBAM), you can choose an installation that integrates Microsoft BitLocker Administration and Monitoring with System Center Configuration Manager. For a list of the supported versions of Configuration Manager, see [Planning to Deploy MBAM with Configuration Manager](planning-to-deploy-mbam-with-configuration-manager-2.md).

This integration moves the Microsoft BitLocker Administration and Monitoring compliance and reporting infrastructure into the native environment of Microsoft System Center Configuration Manager. With the Configuration Manager topology, IT administrators can view reports and the compliance status of their enterprise from the Configuration Manager Management Console.

**Important**  
Windows To Go is not supported when you install the integrated topology of MBAM with Configuration Manager 2007.
