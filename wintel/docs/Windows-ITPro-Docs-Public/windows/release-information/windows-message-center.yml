If you have difficulty installing Windows updates, verify that you have installed the latest SSU package for your version of Windows and then try installing the update again. Links to the latest SSU are always provided in the “How to get this update” section of each update KB article (e.g., <a href='https://support.microsoft.com/help/4494441' target='_blank'>KB4494441</a>).

This vulnerability affects Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2, and earlier versions of Windows nearing end of support. It does not affect Windows 8, Windows Server 2012, or newer operating systems. While we have not observed attacks exploiting this vulnerability, affected systems should be patched with priority. Here is what you need to know:<br> <br>
<strong>Call to action:</strong>
<ul>
<li>	If you are running a supported version of Windows and have automatic updates enabled, you are automatically protected and do not need to take any action. </li>
<li>	If you are managing updates on behalf of your organization, you should download the latest updates from the <a href='https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/' target='_blank'>Microsoft Security Update Guide</a> and apply them to your Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2, and Windows Server 2008 devices as soon as possible.</li>
</ul>
Given the potential impact to customers and their businesses, we have also released <a href='https://support.microsoft.com/help/4500705' target='_blank'>security updates for Windows XP and Windows Server 2003</a>, even though these operating systems have reached end of support (except by custom support agreements). While we recommend that you upgrade to the current version of Windows to benefit from the latest security protections, these updates are available from the Microsoft Update Catalog only. For more information, see <a href='https://support.microsoft.com/help/4500705' target='_blank'>KB4500705</a>.

Here's a quick recap of our releases and servicing cadence: <br>
 <ul>
<li>	April 9, 2019 was the regular Update Tuesday release for all versions of Windows.</li> 
<li>	May 1, 2019 was an \\\"optional,\\\" out of band non-security update (OOB) for Windows 10, version 1809. It was released to Microsoft Catalog and WSUS, providing a critical fix for our OEM partners.</li>
<li>	May 3, 2019 was the \\\"optional\\\" Windows 10, version 1809 \\\"C\\\" release for April. This update contained important <a href='https://support.microsoft.com/help/4470918/updates-for-may-2019-japan-era-change' target='_blank'>Japanese era</a> packages for commercial customers to preview. It was released later than expected and mistakenly targeted as \\\"required\\\" (instead of \\\"optional\\\") for consumers, which pushed the update out to customers and required a reboot. Within 24 hours of receiving customer reports, we corrected the targeting logic and mitigated the issue.</li>
 </ul>
