# Deploy Windows 10 with Microsoft 365

**Applies to**

-   WindowsÂ 10

This topic provides a brief overview of Microsoft 365 and describes how to use a free 90-day trial account to review some of the benefits of Microsoft 365.

[Microsoft 365](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365) is a new offering from Microsoft that combines [Windows 10](https://www.microsoft.com/windows/features) with [Office 365](https://products.office.com/business/explore-office-365-for-business), and [Enterprise Mobility and Security](https://www.microsoft.com/cloud-platform/enterprise-mobility-security) (EMS). See the [M365 Enterprise poster](#m365-enterprise-poster) for an overview.

For Windows 10 deployment, Microsoft 365 includes a fantastic deployment advisor that can walk you through the entire process of deploying Windows 10. The wizard supports multiple Windows 10 deployment methods, including:

- Windows Autopilot
- In-place upgrade
- Deploying Windows 10 upgrade with Intune
- Deploying Windows 10 upgrade with System Center Configuration Manager
- Deploying a computer refresh with System Center Configuration Manager
