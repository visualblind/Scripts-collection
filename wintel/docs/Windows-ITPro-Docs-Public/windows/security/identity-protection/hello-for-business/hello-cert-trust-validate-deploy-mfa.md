# Validate and Deploy Multi-factor Authentication (MFA)

**Applies to**

- WindowsÂ 10, version 1703 or later
- On-premises deployment
- Certificate trust

Windows Hello for Business requires all users perform multi-factor authentication prior to creating and registering a Windows Hello for Business credential.  On-premises deployments can use certificates, third-party authentication providers for AD FS, or a custom authentication provider for AD FS as an on-premises MFA option.

For information on available third-party authentication methods see [Configure Additional Authentication Methods for AD FS](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-server/identity/ad-fs/operations/configure-additional-authentication-methods-for-ad-fs). For creating a custom authentication method see [Build a Custom Authentication Method for AD FS in Windows Server](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-server/identity/ad-fs/development/ad-fs-build-custom-auth-method)

Follow the integration and deployment guide for the authentication provider you select to integrate and deploy it to AD FS. Make sure that the authentication provider is selected as a multi-factor authentication option in the AD FS authentication policy. For information on configuring AD FS authentication policies see [Configure Authentication Policies](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-server/identity/ad-fs/operations/configure-authentication-policies).
