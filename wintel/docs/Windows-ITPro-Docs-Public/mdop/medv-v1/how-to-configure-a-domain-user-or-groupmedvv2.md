# How to Configure a Domain User or Group


The deployment settings enable you to control which users or groups can access the MED-V workspace, as well as how long the MED-V workspace can be utilized and whether it can be used offline. You can also configure additional rules to control access between the MED-V workspace and the host.

All MED-V workspace permissions are configured in the **Policy** module, on the **Deployment** tab.

To allow users to utilize the MED-V workspace, you must first add domain users or groups to the MED-V workspace permissions. You can then set permissions for each user or group.

## How to Add a Domain User or Group


**To add a domain user or group**

1.  In the **Users / Groups** window, click **Add.**

2.  In the **Enter User or Group names** dialog box, select domain users or groups by doing one of the following:

    -   In the **Enter User or Group names** field, type a user or group that exists in the domain or as a local user or group on the computer. Then click **Check Names** to resolve it to the full existent name.

    -   Click **Find** to open the standard **Select Users or Groups** dialog box. Then select domain users or groups.

3.  Click **OK**.

    The domain users or groups are added.

    **Note**  
    Users from trusted domains should be added manually.

**Warning**  
Do not run the management application from a computer that is part of a domain that is not trusted by the domain the server is installed on.
