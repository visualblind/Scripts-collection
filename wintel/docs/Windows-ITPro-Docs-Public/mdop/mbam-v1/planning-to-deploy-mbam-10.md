# Planning to Deploy MBAM 1.0


You should consider a number of different deployment configurations and prerequisites before you create your Microsoft BitLocker Administration and Monitoring (MBAM) 1.0 deployment plan. This section includes information that can help you gather the information that you must have to formulate a deployment plan that best meets your business requirements.

## Review the MBAM 1.0 supported configurations


After you prepare your computing environment for the MBAM Client and Server feature installation, make sure that you review the Supported Configurations information for MBAM to confirm that the computers on which you install MBAM meet the minimum hardware and operating system requirements. For more information about MBAM deployment prerequisites, see [MBAM 1.0 Deployment Prerequisites](mbam-10-deployment-prerequisites.md).

## Plan for MBAM 1.0 Server and Client deployment


The MBAM server infrastructure depends on a set of server features that can be installed on one or more server computers, based on the requirements of the enterprise. These features can be installed on a single server or distributed across multiple servers.

The MBAM Client enables administrators to enforce and monitor the BitLocker drive encryption on computers in the enterprise. The BitLocker client can be integrated into an organization by deploying the client through tools like Active Directory Domain Services or by directly encrypting the client computers as part of the initial imaging process.

With MBAM, you can encrypt a computer in your organization either before the end user receives the computer or afterwards, by using Group Policy. You can use one or both methods in your organization. If you choose to use both methods, you can improve compliance, reporting, and key recovery support.
