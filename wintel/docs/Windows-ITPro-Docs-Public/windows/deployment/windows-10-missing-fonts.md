# How to install fonts that are missing after upgrading to Windows 10

> Applies to: Windows 10

When you upgrade from the Windows 7, Windows 8, or Windows 8.1 operating system to Windows 10, certain fonts are no longer available by default post-upgrade. To reduce the operating system footprint, improve performance, and optimize disk space usage, we moved many of the fonts that were previously shipped with prior versions of Windows to the optional features of Windows 10. If you install a fresh instance of Windows 10, or upgrade an older version of Windows to Windows 10, these optional features are not enabled by default. As a result, these fonts appear to be missing from the system.

If you have documents created using the missing fonts, these documents might display differently on Windows 10.

For example, if you have an English (or French, German, or Spanish) version of Windows 10 installed, you might notice that fonts such as the following are appear to be missing:

- Gautami
- Meiryo
- Narkism/Batang
- BatangChe
- Dotum
- DotumChe
- Gulim
- GulimChe
- Gungsuh
- GungsuhChe

If you want to use these fonts, you can enable the optional feature to add these back to your system. Be aware that this is a permanent change in behavior for Windows 10, and it will remain this way in future releases.

## Installing language-associated features via language settings:

If you want to use the fonts from the optional feature and you know that you will want to view Web pages, edit documents, or use apps in the language associated with that feature, add that language into your user profile. You do this the Settings app.

For example, here are the steps to install the fonts associated with the Hebrew language:

1. Click **Start > Settings**.
2. In Settings, click **Time & language**, and then click **Region & language**.
3. If Hebrew is not included in the list of languages, click the plus sign (**+**) to add a language.
4. Find Hebrew, and then click it to add it to your language list.

Once you have added Hebrew to your language list, then the optional Hebrew font feature and other optional features for Hebrew language support are installed. This should only take a few minutes.

> Note: The optional features are installed by Windows Update. This means you need to be online for the Windows Update service to work.

## Install optional fonts manually without changing language settings:

If you want to use fonts in an optional feature but don't need to search web pages, edit documents, or use apps in the associated language, you can install the optional font features manually without changing your language settings.

For example, here are the steps to install the fonts associated with the Hebrew language without adding the Hebrew language itself to your language preferences:

1. Click **Start > Settings**.
2. In Settings, click **Apps**, click **Apps & features**, and then click **Manage optional features**.

3. If you don't see **Hebrew Supplemental Fonts** in the list of installed features, click the plus sign (**+**) to add a feature.
4. Select **Hebrew Supplemental Fonts** in the list, and then click **Install**.

> Note: The optional features are installed by Windows Update. You need to be online for the Windows Update service to work.
