# Roles and permissions in Microsoft Store for Business and Education
The first person to sign in to Microsoft Store for Business or Microsoft Store for Education must be a Global Admin of the Azure Active Directory (AD) tenant. Once the Global Admin has signed in, they can give permissions to others employees.

Microsoft Store for Business and Education has a set of roles that help admins and employees manage access to apps and tasks for Microsoft Store. Employees with these roles will need to use their Azure AD account to access the Store. Global Administrators and global user accounts that are used with other Microsoft services, such as Azure, or Office 365 can sign in to Microsoft Store. Global user accounts have some permissions in Microsoft Store, and Microsoft Store has a set of roles that help IT admins and employees manage access to apps and tasks for Microsoft Store.
