# Editing Windows IT professional documentation

## Editing topics

We've tried to make editing an existing, public file as simple as possible.

>**Note**<br>
>At this time, only the English (en-us) content is available for editing.

**To edit a topic**

1. Go to the page on docs.microsoft.com that you want to update, and then click **Edit**.

2. Log into (or sign up for) a GitHub account.
    
    You must have a GitHub account to get to the page that lets you edit a topic.

3. Click the **Pencil** icon (in the red box) to edit the content.

4. Using Markdown language, make your changes to the topic. For info about how to edit content using Markdown, see:
    - **If you're linked to the Microsoft organization in GitHub:** [Windows authoring guide](https://aka.ms/WindowsAuthoring)
    
    - **If you're external to Microsoft:** [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) 

5. Make your suggested change, and then click **Preview Changes** to make sure it looks correct.

6. When you’re done editing the topic, scroll to the bottom of the page, and then click **Propose file change** to create a fork in your personal GitHub account.

    ![GitHub Web, showing the Propose file change button](images/propose-file-change.png)

    The **Comparing changes** screen appears to see what the changes are between your fork and the original content.

7. On the **Comparing changes** screen, you’ll see if there are any problems with the file you’re checking in.

    If there are no problems, you’ll see the message, **Able to merge**.

8. Click **Create pull request**.

9. Enter a title and description to give the approver the appropriate context about what’s in the request.

10. Scroll to the bottom of the page, making sure that only your changed files are in this pull request. Otherwise, you could overwrite changes from other people.

11. Click **Create pull request** again to actually submit the pull request.

    The pull request is sent to the writer of the topic and your edits are reviewed. If your request is accepted, updates are published to one of the following places:

    - [Windows 10](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/windows-10)
    
    - [Microsoft Edge](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-edge/deploy)
    
    - [Surface](https://docs.microsoft.com/surface)
    
    - [Surface Hub](https://docs.microsoft.com/surface-hub)
    
    - [HoloLens](https://docs.microsoft.com/hololens)

## Making more substantial changes

To make substantial changes to an existing article, add or change images, or contribute a new article, you will need to create a local clone of the content. 
For info about creating a fork or clone, see the GitHub help topic, [Fork a Repo](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/).

Fork the official repo into your personal GitHub account, and then clone the fork down to your local device.  Work locally, then push your changes back into your fork.  Then open a pull request back to the master branch of the official repo.

## Using issues to provide feedback on documentation

If you just want to provide feedback rather than directly modifying actual documentation pages, you can create an issue in the repository.

At the top of a topic page you'll see an **Issues** tab. Click the tab and then click the **New issue** button. 

Be sure to include the topic title and the URL for the page you're submitting the issue for, if that page is different from the page you launched the **New issue** dialog from.
