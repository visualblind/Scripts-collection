# Identify Differences Between GPOs, GPO Versions, or Templates


You can generate HTML-based or XML-based difference reports to analyze the differences between Group Policy objects (GPOs), templates, or different versions of a GPO.

A user account with the Reviewer, Editor, Approver, or AGPM Administrator (Full Control) role or necessary permissions in Advanced Group Policy Management is required to complete this procedure. Review the details in "Additional considerations" in this topic.

## Identifying differences between GPOs, GPO versions, or templates

2.  On the **Contents** tab in the details pane, click a tab to display GPOs (or templates, if comparing two templates).

3.  Select the two GPOs or templates.

4.  Right-click one of the GPOs or templates, click **Differences**, and then click **HTML Report** or **XML Report** to display a difference report summarizing the settings of the GPOs or templates.

-   For items with changed settings, the changed settings are identified when the item is expanded. The value for the attribute in each GPO is displayed in the same order that the GPOs are displayed in the report.

-   Some changes to settings may cause an item to be reported as two different items (one present only in the first GPO, one present only in the second) rather than as one item that has changed.

### Additional considerations

-   By default, you must be a Reviewer, an Editor, an Approver, or an AGPM Administrator (Full Control) to perform this procedure. Specifically, you must have **List Contents** and **Read Settings** permissions for the GPO. Also, to display the list of GPOs, you must have **List Contents** permission for the domain.
