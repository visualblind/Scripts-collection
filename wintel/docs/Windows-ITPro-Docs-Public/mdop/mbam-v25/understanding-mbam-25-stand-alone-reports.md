# Understanding MBAM 2.5 Stand-alone Reports


This topic describes the reports that are available when you are running Microsoft BitLocker Administration and Monitoring (MBAM) in the Stand-alone topology.

**Note**  
If you are running MBAM with the Configuration Manager Integration topology, you generate reports from Configuration Manager rather than from MBAM. See [Viewing MBAM 2.5 Reports for the Configuration Manager Integration Topology](viewing-mbam-25-reports-for-the-configuration-manager-integration-topology.md) for more information about these reports.



## Understanding the MBAM Stand-alone topology reports


MBAM provides three report types that you can use to monitor your organization for BitLocker compliance:

-   [Enterprise Compliance Report](#bkmk-enterprisecompliance)

-   [Computer Compliance Report](#bkmk-compliance)

-   [Recovery Audit Report](#bkmk-recovery)

To access MBAM reports when you are running MBAM in the Stand-alone topology, open a web browser, and then open the Administration and Monitoring Website. Select **Reports** in the left menu bar. From the top menu bar, select the kind of report that you want to generate. For more information about generating these reports, see [Generating MBAM 2.5 Stand-alone Reports](generating-mbam-25-stand-alone-reports.md).

### <a href="" id="bkmk-enterprisecompliance"></a>Enterprise Compliance Report

Use this report type to collect information about overall BitLocker compliance in your organization. You can use filters to narrow your search results to learn more about the compliance state and error status of computers in your organization.

### <a href="" id="bkmk-compliance"></a>Computer Compliance Report

Use this report type to collect information that is specific to a computer or user.

View this report by clicking the computer name in the Enterprise Compliance Report, or by typing the computer name in the Computer Compliance Report. This report shows detailed encryption information about each drive (operating system and fixed data drives) on a computer. It also indicates the policy that is applied to each drive type on the computer. To view the details of each drive, expand the Computer Name entry.

**Note**  
Removable Data Volume encryption status is not shown in this report.

### <a href="" id="bkmk-recovery"></a>Recovery Audit Report

Use this report type to audit users who have requested access to BitLocker recovery keys. The report offers several filters based on the desired filtering criteria. You can filter on a specific type of user (a Help Desk user or an end user), whether the request failed or was successful, the specific type of key requested, and a date range during which the retrieval occurred.
