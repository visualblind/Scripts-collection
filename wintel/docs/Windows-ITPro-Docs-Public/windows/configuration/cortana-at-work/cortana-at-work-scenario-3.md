# Test scenario 3 - Set a reminder for a specific location using Cortana at work

-   Windows 10, version 1703
-   Windows 10 Mobile, version 1703

>[!IMPORTANT]
>The data created as part of these scenarios will be uploaded to Microsoft’s Cloud to help Cortana learn and help your employees. This is the same info that Cortana uses in the consumer offering.

This scenario helps you set up, review, and edit a reminder based on a location. For example, reminding yourself to grab your expense report receipts before you leave the house.

>[!NOTE]
>You can set each reminder location individually as you create the reminders, or you can go into the **About me** screen and add both **Work** and **Home** addresses as favorites. Make sure that you use real addresses since you’ll need to go to these locations to complete your testing scenario.<p>Additionally, if you’ve turned on the **Meeting & reminder cards & notifications** option (in the **Meetings & reminders** option of your Notebook), you’ll also see your pending reminders on the Cortana **Home** page.

3. Choose **Arrive** from the drop-down box, and then type a location to associate with your reminder. For example, you can use the physical address of where you work. Just make sure you can physically get to your location, so you can test the reminder.

4. Click **Done**.

    >[!NOTE]
    >If you’ve never used this location before, you’ll be asked to add a name for it so it can be added to the **Favorites list** in Windows Maps.

5. Choose to be reminded the **Next time you arrive at the location** or on a specific day of the week from the drop-down box.

6. Take a picture of your receipts and store them locally on your device.
