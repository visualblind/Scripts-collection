# How to Migrate Extension Points From an App-V 4.6 Package to a Converted App-V 5.0 Package for All Users on a Specific Computer

**Note:** App-V 4.6 has exited Mainstream support.

Use the following procedure to migrate extension points from an App-V 4.6 package to a App-V 5.0 package using the deployment configuration file.

**Note**  
The following procedure does not require an App-V 5.0 management server.

 

**To migrate extension points from a package from an App-V 4.6 package to a converted App-V 5.0 package using the deployment configuration file**

1. Locate the directory that contains the deployment configuration file for the package you want to migrate. To set the policy, make the following update to the **userConfiguration** section:

   **ManagingAuthority TakeoverExtensionPointsFrom46="true" PackageName=&lt;Package ID&gt;**

   The following is an example of content from a deployment configuration file:

   &lt;?xml version="1.0" ?&gt;

   &lt;DeploymentConfiguration

   xmlns="<http://schemas.microsoft.com/appv/2010/deploymentconfiguration>" PackageId=&lt;Package ID&gt; DisplayName=&lt;Display Name&gt;

   &lt;MachineConfiguration/&gt;

   &lt;UserConfiguration&gt;

   &lt;ManagingAuthority TakeoverExtensionPointsFrom46="true"

   PackageName=&lt;Package ID&gt;

   &lt;/UserConfiguration&gt;

   &lt;/DeploymentConfiguration&gt;

2. To add the App-V 5.0 package, in an elevated PowerShell command prompt type:

   PS&gt;**$pkg= Add-AppvClientPackage** **–Path** &lt;Path to package location&gt; -**DynamicDeploymentConfiguration** &lt;Path to the deployment configuration file&gt;

   PS&gt;**Publish-AppVClientPackage $pkg**

3. To test the migration, open the virtual application using associated FTAs or shortcuts. The application opens with App-V 5.0. Both, the App-V 4.6 package and the converted App-V 5.0 package are published to the user, but the FTAs and shortcuts for the applications have been assumed by the App-V 5.0 package.
