## PhoneMobileOperatorDisplayName

Enter a friendly name for the mobile operator. This string is displayed in the support section of the **Settings > About** screen and in the ringtone list.

## PhoneMobileOperatorName

This setting is used for targeting phone updates. It must contain a code specified by Microsoft that corresponds to the mobile operator. These codes are provided in [Registry values for mobile operator IDs](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/dn772250.aspx). For open market phones, in which the mobile operator is not known, use the codes in [Registry values for carrier-unlocked phones](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/dn772248.aspx) instead.

This string is not visible to the user.

This setting must not be changed over time even if the user switches SIMs or mobile operators, as updates are always targeted based on the first mobile operator associated with the phone.

The [PhoneManufacturer](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/mt138328.aspx), [PhoneManufacturerModelName](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/mt138336.aspx), and PhoneMobileOperatorName should create a unique Phone-Operator-Pairing (POP).



## PhoneOEMSupportLink

This should be a functional link that starts with http://. The link should be a URL that redirects to the mobile version of the web page. The content in the webpage should reflow to the screen width. This can be achieved by adding the CSS Tag `"@-ms-viewport { width: device-width; }"`.

The default is an empty string (""), which means that a support link will not be displayed to the user.

This setting varies by OEM.
