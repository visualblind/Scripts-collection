# Using the Surface Hub Recovery Tool

The [Microsoft Surface Hub Recovery Tool](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=52210) helps you re-image your Surface Hub Solid State Drive (SSD) using a Windows 10 desktop device, without calling support or replacing the SSD. With this tool, you can reimage an SSD that has an unknown Administrator password, boot errors, was unable to complete a cloud recovery, or for a device that has an older version of the operating system. The tool will not fix physically damaged SSDs.

To re-image the Surface Hub SSD using the Recovery Tool, you'll need to remove the SSD from the Surface Hub, connect the drive to the USB-to-SATA cable, and then connect the cable to the desktop PC on which the Recovery Tool is installed. For more information on how to remove the existing drive from your Surface Hub, see [Surface Hub SSD replacement](surface-hub-ssd-replacement.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Do not let the device go to sleep or interrupt the download of the image file.

If the tool is unsuccessful in reimaging your drive, please contact [Surface Hub Support](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4037644/surface-contact-surface-warranty-and-software-support).

5. When the download is complete, the tool instructs you to connect an SSD drive. If the tool is unable to locate the attached drive, there is a good chance that the cable being used is not reporting the name of the SSD to Windows.  The imaging tool must find the name of the drive as "LITEON L CH-128V2S USB Device" before it can continue.  For more information on how to remove the existing drive from your Surface Hub, see [Surface Hub SSD replacement](surface-hub-ssd-replacement.md).

    Prior to applying the system image to the drive, the SSD is repartitioned and formatted. Copying the system binaries will take approximately 30 minutes, but can take longer depending on the speed of your USB bus, the cable being used, or antivirus software installed on your system.
