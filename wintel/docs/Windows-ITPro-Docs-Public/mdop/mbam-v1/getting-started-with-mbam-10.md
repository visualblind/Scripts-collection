# Getting Started with MBAM 1.0


Microsoft BitLocker Administration and Monitoring (MBAM) requires thorough planning before you deploy it or use its features. Because this product can affect every computer in your organization, you might disrupt your entire network if you do not plan your deployment carefully. However, if you plan your deployment carefully and manage it so that it meets your business needs, MBAM can help reduce your administrative overhead and total cost of ownership.

If you are new to this product, we recommend that you read the documentation thoroughly. Before you deploy it to a production environment, we also recommend that you validate your deployment plan in a test network environment. You might also consider taking a class about relevant technologies. For more information about Microsoft training opportunities, see the Microsoft Training Overview at <https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=80347>.

You can find a downloadable version of this documentation and the MBAM Evaluation Guide at <https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=225356>.

 

This section of the MBAM Administrator’s Guide includes high-level information about MBAM to provide you with a basic understanding of the product before you begin the deployment planning. Additional MBAM documentation can be found on the MBAM Documentation Resources Download page at <https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=258391>.
