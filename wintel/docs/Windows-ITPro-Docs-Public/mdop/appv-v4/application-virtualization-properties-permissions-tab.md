# Application Virtualization Properties: Permissions Tab


Use the **Permissions** tab of the **Application Virtualization Properties** dialog box to specify which activities are available for non-administrators on the local computer. Select the check boxes that correspond to the items you want to make available to all users. Users who do not have administrative rights can view this page and see which items are selected, but they cannot modify the list.
