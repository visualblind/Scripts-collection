# How to Move MBAM 1.0 Features to Another Computer


This topic describes the steps that you should take to move one or more Microsoft BitLocker Administration and Monitoring (MBAM) features to a different computer. When you move more than one MBAM feature to another computer, you should move them in the following order:

1.  Recovery and Hardware Database

2.  Compliance and Audit Database

3.  Compliance and Audit Reports

4.  Administration and Monitoring

## To move the Recovery and Hardware Database


You can use the following procedure to move the MBAM Recovery and Hardware Database from one computer to another (you can move this MBAM Server feature from Server A to Server B):

****

1.  Stop all instances of the MBAM Administration and Monitoring web site.

2.  Run the MBAM Setup on Server B.

3.  Back up the MBAM Recovery and Hardware database on Server A.

4.  MBAM Recovery and Hardware database from Server A to B

5.  Restore the MBAM Recovery and Hardware database on Server B

6.  Configure the access to the MBAM Recovery and Hardware database on Server B

7.  Update the database connection data on MBAM Administration and Monitoring servers

8.  Resume all instances of the MBAM Administration and Monitoring web site

**To stop all instances of the MBAM Administration and Monitoring website**

1.  Use the Internet Information Services (IIS) Manager console to stop the MBAM website on each of the servers that run the MBAM Administration and Monitoring feature. The MBAM website is named **Microsoft BitLocker Administration and Monitoring**.

2.  To automate this procedure, you can use a command at the command prompt that is similar to the following, by using Windows PowerShell:

    `PS C:\> Stop-Website “Microsoft BitLocker Administration and Monitoring”`

    **Note**  
    To run this PowerShell command prompt, you must add the IIS Module for PowerShell to the current instance of PowerShell. In addition, you must update the PowerShell execution policy to enable the execution of scripts.



**To run MBAM setup on Server B**

1.  Run the MBAM setup on Server B and select the Recovery and Hardware Database for installation.

2.  To automate this procedure, you can use a command at the command prompt that is similar to the following, by using Windows PowerShell:

    `PS C:\> MbamSetup.exe /qn I_ACCEPT_ENDUSER_LICENSE_AGREEMENT=1 AddLocal=KeyDatabase ADMINANDMON_MACHINENAMES=$DOMAIN$\$SERVERNAME$$ RECOVERYANDHWDB_SQLINSTANCE=$SERVERNAME$\$SQLINSTANCENAME$`

    **Note**  
    Replace the following values in the example above with those that match your environment:

    -   $SERVERNAME$\\$SQLINSTANCENAME$ - Enter the name of the server and instance to which the Recovery and Hardware database will be moved.

    -   $DOMAIN$\\$SERVERNAME$ - Enter the domain and server names of each MBAM Application and Monitoring Server that will contact the Recovery and Hardware database. If there are multiple domain and server names, use a semicolon to separate each one of them in the list. For example, $DOMAIN\\SERVERNAME$;$DOMAIN\\$SERVERNAME$$. Additionally, each server name must be followed by a **$**. For example, MyDomain\\MyServerName1$, MyDomain\\MyServerName2$.



**To back up the Database on Server A**

1.  To back up the Recovery and Hardware database on Server A, use SQL Server Management Studio and the Task named **Back Up…**. By default, the database name is **MBAM Recovery and Hardware Database**.

2.  To automate this procedure, create a SQL file (.sql) that contains the following SQL script:

    Modify the MBAM Recovery and Hardware Database to use the full recovery mode.

    ```sql
    USE master;

    GO

    ALTER DATABASE "MBAM Recovery and Hardware"

       SET RECOVERY FULL;

    GO
    ```

    Create MBAM Recovery and Hardware Database Data and MBAM Recovery logical backup devices.

    ```sql
    USE master

    GO

    EXEC sp_addumpdevice 'disk', 'MBAM Recovery and Hardware Database Data Device',

    'Z:\MBAM Recovery and Hardware Database Data.bak';

    GO
    ```

    Back up the full MBAM Recovery and Hardware database.

    ```sql
    BACKUP DATABASE [MBAM Recovery and Hardware] TO [MBAM Recovery and Hardware Database Data Device];

    GO

    BACKUP CERTIFICATE [MBAM Recovery Encryption Certificate]

    TO FILE = 'Z:\SQLServerInstanceCertificateFile'

    WITH PRIVATE KEY

    (

        FILE = ' Z:\SQLServerInstanceCertificateFilePrivateKey',

        ENCRYPTION BY PASSWORD = '$PASSWORD$'

    );

    GO
    ```

    **Note**  
    Replace the values from the preceding example with those that match your environment:

    -   $PASSWORD$ - Enter a password that you will use to encrypt the Private Key file.



3.  Execute the SQL file by using SQL Server PowerShell and a command that is similar to the following:

    `PS C:\> Invoke-Sqlcmd -InputFile 'Z:\BackupMBAMRecoveryandHardwarDatabaseScript.sql' -ServerInstance $SERVERNAME$\$SQLINSTANCENAME$`

    **Note**  
    Replace the value in the previous example with those that match your environment:

    -   $SERVERNAME$\\$SQLINSTANCENAME$ - Enter the name of the server and the instance from which you back up the Recovery and Hardware database.



**To move the Database and Certificate from Server A to B**

1.  Move the MBAM Recovery and Hardware database data.bak from Server A to Server B by using Windows Explorer.

2.  To move the certificate for the encrypted database, you will need to use the following automation steps. To automate this procedure, you can use Windows PowerShell to enter a command that is similar to the following:

    `PS C:\> Copy-Item “Z:\MBAM Recovery and Hardware Database Data.bak” \\$SERVERNAME$\$DESTINATIONSHARE$`

    `PS C:\> Copy-Item “Z:\SQLServerInstanceCertificateFile” \\$SERVERNAME$\$DESTINATIONSHARE$`

    `PS C:\> Copy-Item “Z:\SQLServerInstanceCertificateFilePrivateKey” \\$SERVERNAME$\$DESTINATIONSHARE$`

    **Note**  
    Replace the value from the preceding example with those that match your environment:

    -   $SERVERNAME$ - Enter the name of the server to which the files will be copied.

    -   $DESTINATIONSHARE$ - Enter the name of the share and path to which the files will be copied.



**To restore the Database on Server B**

1.  Restore the Recovery and Hardware database on Server B by using the SQL Server Management Studio and the Task named **Restore Database**.

2.  Once the task has been executed, choose the database backup file by selecting the **From Device** option, and then use the **Add** command to choose the MBAM Recovery and Hardware database **Data.bak** file.

3.  Select **OK** to complete the restoration process.

4.  To automate this procedure, create a SQL file (.sql) that contains the following SQL script:

    ```sql
    -- Restore MBAM Recovery and Hardware Database. 

    USE master

    GO
    ```

    Drop the certificate created by MBAM Setup.

    ```sql
    DROP CERTIFICATE [MBAM Recovery Encryption Certificate]

    GO
    ```

    Add certificate

    ```sql
    CREATE CERTIFICATE [MBAM Recovery Encryption Certificate]

    FROM FILE = 'Z: \SQLServerInstanceCertificateFile'

    WITH PRIVATE KEY

    (

        FILE = ' Z:\SQLServerInstanceCertificateFilePrivateKey',

        DECRYPTION BY PASSWORD = '$PASSWORD$'

    );

    GO
    ```

    Restore the MBAM Recovery and Hardware database data and the log files.

    ```sql
    RESTORE DATABASE [MBAM Recovery and Hardware]

       FROM DISK = 'Z:\MBAM Recovery and Hardware Database Data.bak'

       WITH REPLACE
    ```

    **Note**
