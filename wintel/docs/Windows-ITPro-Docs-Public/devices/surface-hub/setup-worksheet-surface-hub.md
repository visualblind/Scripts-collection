# Setup worksheet (Surface Hub)


When you've finished pre-setup and are ready to start first-time setup for your Microsoft Surface Hub, make sure you have all the information listed in this section.

You should fill out one list for each Surface Hub you need to configure, although some information can be used on all Surface Hubs, like the proxy information or domain credentials. Some of this information may not be needed, depending on how you've decided to configure your device, or depending on how the environment is configured for your organization's infrastructure.

The device name you choose must not be the same name as any other device on the user’s Active Directory domain (if you decide to domain join the device). The device cannot join the domain if its name is not unique.
