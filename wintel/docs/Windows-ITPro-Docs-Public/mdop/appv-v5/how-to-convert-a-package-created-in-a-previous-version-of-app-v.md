# How to Convert a Package Created in a Previous Version of App-V


You can use the package converter utility to upgrade virtual application packages that have been created with previous versions of App-V.

**Note**  
If you are running a computer with a 64-bit architecture, you must use the x86 version of PowerShell.



The package converter can only directly convert packages that were created by using the App-V 4.5 sequencer or a subsequent version. Packages that were created using a version prior to App-V 4.5 must be upgraded to the App-V 4.5 or App-V 4.6 format before conversion.

The following information provides direction for converting existing virtual application packages.

**Important**  
You must configure the package converter to always save the package ingredients file to a secure location and directory. A secure location is accessible only by an administrator. Additionally, when you deploy the package, you should save the package to a location that is secure, or make sure that no other user is allowed to be logged in during the conversion process.



**Getting started**

1.  Install the App-V Sequencer on a computer in your environment. For information about how to install the Sequencer, see [How to Install the Sequencer](how-to-install-the-sequencer-beta-gb18030.md).

2. Import the required Powershell Module

```powershell
Import-Module AppVPkgConverter
```

3. The following cmdlets are available:

   -   Test-AppvLegacyPackage – This cmdlet is designed to check packages. It will return information about any failures with the package such as missing **.sft** files, an invalid source, **.osd** file errors, or invalid package version. This cmdlet will not parse the **.sft** file or do any in depth validation. For information about options and basic functionality for this cmdlet, using the PowerShell cmdline, type `Test-AppvLegacyPackage -?`.

   -   ConvertFrom-AppvLegacyPackage – To convert an existing package, type `ConvertFrom-AppvLegacyPackage c:\contentStore c:\convertedPackages`. In this command, `c:\contentStore` represents the location of the existing package and `c:\convertedPackages` is the output directory to which the resulting App-V 5.0 virtual application package file will be saved. By default, if you do not specify a new name, the old package name will be used for the App-V 5.0 filename.

       Additionally, the package converter optimizes performance of packages in App-V 5.0 by setting the package to stream fault the App-V package.  This is more performant than the primary feature block and fully downloading the package. The flag **DownloadFullPackageOnFirstLaunch** allows you to convert the package and set the package to be fully downloaded by default.

       **Note**  
       Before you specify the output directory, you must create the output directory.

**Advanced Conversion Tips**

-   Piping - PowerShell supports piping. Piping allows you to call `dir c:\contentStore\myPackage | Test-AppvLegacyPackage`. In this example, the directory object that represents `myPackage` will be given as input to the `Test-AppvLegacyPackage` command and bound to the `-Source` parameter. Piping like this is especially useful when you want to batch commands together; for example, `dir .\ | Test-AppvLegacyPackage | ConvertFrom-AppvLegacyAppvPackage -Target .\ConvertedPackages`. This piped command would test the packages and then pass those objects on to actually be converted. You can also apply a filter on packages without errors or only specify a directory which contains an **.sprj** file or pipe them to another cmdlet that adds the filtered package to the server or publishes them to the App-V 5.0 client.

-   Batching - The PowerShell command enables batching. More specifically, the cmdlets support taking a string\[\] object for the `-Source` parameter which represents a list of directory paths. This allows you to enter `$packages = dir c:\contentStore` and then call `ConvertFrom-AppvLegacyAppvPackage-Source $packages -Target c:\ConvertedPackages` or to use piping and call `dir c:\ContentStore | ConvertFrom-AppvLegacyAppvPackage -Target C:\ConvertedPackages`.

-   Other functionality - PowerShell has other built-in functionality for features such as aliases, piping, lazy-binding, .NET object, and many others. All of these are usable in PowerShell and can help you create advanced scenarios for the Package Converter.
