# How to Refresh Virtual Applications from the Desktop Notification Area


To refresh the list of available applications and the associated shortcuts and file type associations, you must refresh the publishing information from the Application Virtualization (App-V) Management Server or the Application Virtualization (App-V) Streaming Server before the applications appear on your desktop. You can accomplish this directly from the notification area on your desktop.

**To refresh the virtual applications from the client desktop**

1.  Right-click the Application Virtualization System icon in the notification area.

2.  Select **Refresh Applications** from the pop-up-menu.

    Your desktop is updated, and the client reflects any changes in applications, shortcuts, and file type associations. This applies only when a publishing server has been defined.
