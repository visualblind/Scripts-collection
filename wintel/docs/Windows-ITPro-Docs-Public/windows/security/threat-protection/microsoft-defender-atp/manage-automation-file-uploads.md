Enable the content analysis capability so that certain files and email attachments can automatically be uploaded to the cloud for additional inspection in Automated investigation.

Identify the files and email attachments by specifying the file extension names and email attachment extension names. 

For example, if you add *exe* and *bat* as file or attachment extension names, then all files or attachments with those extensions will automatically be sent to the cloud for additional inspection during Automated investigation. 

## Add file extension names and attachment extension names.

1. In the navigation pane, select **Settings** > **Automation file uploads**. 

2. Toggle the content analysis setting between **On** and **Off**.

3. Configure the following extension names and separate extension names with a comma:
   - **File extension names** -  Suspicious files except email attachments will be submitted for additional inspection
