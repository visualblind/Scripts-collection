# How to Uninstall the App-V Client


Use the following procedure to uninstall the Application Virtualization Client from the computer.

**To uninstall the Application Virtualization Desktop Client**

1.  In Control Panel, double-click **Add or Remove Programs** (or in Windows Vista, **Programs and Features**), and then double-click **Microsoft Application Virtualization Desktop Client**.

2.  In the dialog box that appears, click **Yes** to continue with the uninstall process.

    **Important**  
    The uninstall process cannot be canceled or interrupted.

     

3.  When a message stating that the Microsoft Application Virtualization Client Tray application must be closed before continuing appears, right-click the App-V icon in the notification area and select **Exit** to close the application. Then click **Retry** to continue with the uninstall process.

    **Important**  
    You might see a message stating that one or more virtual applications are in use. Close any open applications and save your data before you continue. Then click **OK** to continue with the uninstall process.

     

4.  A progress bar shows the time remaining. When this step finishes, you must restart the computer so that all associated drivers can be stopped to complete the uninstall process.

    **Note**  
    The following registry keys remain after the uninstall process is complete:

    -   HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Wow6432Node\\Microsoft\\SoftGrid

    -   HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Wow6432Node\\Microsoft\\SoftGrid\\4.5

    -   HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Wow6432Node\\Microsoft\\SoftGrid\\4.5\\SystemGuard "Client"=dword:00000000

    -   HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Wow6432Node\\Microsoft\\SoftGrid\\4.5\\SystemGuard\\SecKey
