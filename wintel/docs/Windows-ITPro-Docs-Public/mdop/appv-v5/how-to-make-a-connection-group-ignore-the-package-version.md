# How to Make a Connection Group Ignore the Package Version


Microsoft Application Virtualization (App-V) 5.0 SP3 enables you to configure a connection group to use any version of a package, which simplifies package upgrades and reduces the number of connection groups you need to create.

To upgrade a package in earlier versions of App-V, you had to perform several steps, including disabling the connection group and modifying the connection group’s XML definition file.

<td align="left"><p>You can configure a connection group to accept any version of a package, which enables you to upgrade the package without having to disable the connection group.</p>
<p><strong>How the feature works:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>If the connection group has access to multiple versions of a package, the latest version is used.</p></li>
<li><p>If the connection group contains an optional package that has an incorrect version, the package is ignored and won’t block the connection group’s virtual environment from being created.</p></li>
<li><p>If the connection group contains a non-optional package that has an incorrect version, the connection group’s virtual environment cannot be created.</p></li>
