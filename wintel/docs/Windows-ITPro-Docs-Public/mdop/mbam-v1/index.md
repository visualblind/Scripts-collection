# Microsoft BitLocker Administration and Monitoring 1 Administrator's Guide

Microsoft BitLocker Administration and Monitoring (MBAM) provides a simplified administrative interface that you can use to manage BitLocker drive encryption. With MBAM, you can select BitLocker encryption policy options that are appropriate to your enterprise and then use them to monitor client compliance with those policies. You can also report on the encryption status of an individual computer and on the entire enterprise. In addition, you can access recovery key information when users forget their PIN or password, or when their BIOS or boot record changes.
