# Manage Surface Hub 2S with Intune

## Register Surface Hub 2S with Intune

Surface Hub 2S allows IT administrators to manage settings and policies using a mobile device management (MDM) provider. Surface Hub 2S has a built-in management component to communicate with the management server, so there is no need to install additional clients on the device.

### Manual registration

1. Sign in as a local administrator on Surface Hub 2S and open the **Settings** app. Select **Surface Hub** > **Device management** and then select **+** to add.
2. After authenticating, the device will automatically register with Intune.

When affiliating Surface Hub 2S with a tenant that has Intune auto enrollment enabled, the device will automatically enroll with Intune.

## Windows 10 Team Edition settings

Select Windows 10 Team for preset device restriction settings for Surface Hub and Surface Hub 2S.
