# Using Application Virtualization Servers as a Package Management Solution


If you do not have an existing ESD system to deploy your Application Virtualization solution or do not wish to use one, you will need to install one or more Application Virtualization Management Servers as the core of your system architecture. The Application Virtualization Management Server requires a dedicated server computer and needs a Microsoft SQL Server database. The database can be on the same server, or it can be configured on a corporate database server that is accessible to the Application Virtualization Management Server over a high-speed LAN connection. In addition, you will need to install the Microsoft Application Virtualization Management Console, on either the Application Virtualization Management Server or on a designated management workstation, and you will need to install the Microsoft Application Virtualization Management Web Service, which can also be installed on the Application Virtualization Management Server or on a separate IIS server. The Application Virtualization Management Console is used to connect to the Application Virtualization Management Web Service, enabling the system administrator to interact with the Application Virtualization Management Server.

**Note**  
Access to the applications is controlled by means of Security Groups in Active Directory Domain Services, so you will need to plan a process to set up a security group for each virtualized application and for managing which users are added to each group. The Application Virtualization Management Server administrator configures the server to use these Active Directory groups, and the server then automatically controls access to the packages based on Active Directory group membership.
