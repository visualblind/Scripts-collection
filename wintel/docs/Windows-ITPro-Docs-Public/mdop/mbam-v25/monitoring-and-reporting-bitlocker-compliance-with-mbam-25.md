# Monitoring and Reporting BitLocker Compliance with MBAM 2.5


Microsoft BitLocker Administration and Monitoring (MBAM) 2.5 provides several reports that you can use to monitor BitLocker usage and compliance activities in your enterprise.

Reports for the MBAM Stand-alone topology and the MBAM Configuration Manager Integration topology differ in the following ways:

-   In the Stand-alone topology, you view reports in the Administration and Monitoring Website. In the Configuration Manager Integration topology, you view reports in the Configuration Manager console, with one exception: you continue to view the Recovery Audit report from the Administration and Monitoring Website.

-   The names of the reports differ slightly between the two topologies. Visit the following links for the names and descriptions of the reports for each topology.
