# How to Manage Reports in the Server Management Console


To effectively manage the Application Virtualization System, you can use the Application Virtualization Server Management Console to generate a variety of reports that provide information about the system. This information includes daily usage information for a specific application or all applications, and system error tracking.

**Note**  
-   During installation, the installation script installs only the English language version of report viewer. For the report viewer to display the correct information in other languages, it is necessary to install a language pack from the following location: <https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=131645>.

-   When you add or edit an application in the Server Management Console, you must make sure that the application names and versions exactly match those in the OSD files. The reporting feature uses the application names and versions data fields when it identifies application usage data on which to report. If the data fields do not match, the usage records will be skipped.
