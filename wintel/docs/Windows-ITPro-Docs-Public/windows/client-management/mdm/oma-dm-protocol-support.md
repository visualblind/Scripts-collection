# OMA DM protocol support

The OMA DM client communicates with the server over HTTPS and uses DM Sync (OMA DM v1.2) as the message payload. This topic describes the OMA DM functionality that the DM client supports in general. The full description of the OMA DM protocol v1.2 can be found at the [OMA website](https://www.openmobilealliance.org/release/DM/V1_2-20070209-A/OMA-TS-DM_Protocol-V1_2-20070209-A.pdf).

## Device management session

A Device Management (DM) session consists of a series of commands exchanged between a DM server and a client device. The server sends commands indicating operations that must be performed on the client device's management tree. The client responds by sending commands that contain the results and any requested status information.

A short DM session can be summarized as the following:

A server sends a Get command to a client device to retrieve the contents of one of the nodes of the management tree. The device performs the operation and responds with a Result command that contains the requested contents.

A DM session can be divided into two phases:
1.  **Setup phase**: In response to a trigger event, a client device sends an initiating message to a DM server. The device and server exchange needed authentication and device information. This phase is represented by steps 1, 2, and 3 in the following table.
2.  **Management phase**: The DM server is in control. It sends management commands to the device and the device responds. Phase two ends when the DM server stops sending commands and terminates the session. This phase is represented by steps 3, 4, and 5 in the following table.

The following table shows the sequence of events during a typical DM session.

</tbody>
</table>



The step numbers in the table do not represent message identification numbers (MsgID). All messages from the server must have a MsgID that is unique within the session, starting at 1 for the first message, and increasing by an increment of 1 for each additional message. For more information about MsgID and OMA SyncML protocol, see "OMA Device Management Representation Protocol" (DM_RepPro-V1_2-20070209-A) available from the [OMA website](https://www.openmobilealliance.org/release/DM/V1_2-20070209-A/).

During OMA DM application level mutual authentication, if the device response code to Cred element in the server request is 212, no further authentication is needed for the remainder of the DM session. In the case of the MD5 authentication, the Chal element can be returned. Then the next nonce in Chal must be used for the MD5 digest when the next DM session is started.

If a request includes credentials and the response code to the request is 200, the same credential must be sent within the next request. If the Chal element is included and the MD5 authentication is required, a new digest is created by using the next nonce via the Chal element for next request.

For more information about Basic or MD5 client authentication, MD5 server authentication, MD5 hash, and MD5 nonce, see the OMA Device Management Security specification (OMA-TS-DM_Security-V1_2_1-20080617-A), authentication response code handling and step-by-step samples in OMA Device Management Protocol specification (OMA-TS-DM_Protocol-V1_2_1-20080617-A), available from the [OMA website](https://www.openmobilealliance.org/release/DM/V1_2_1-20080617-A/).


## User targeted vs. Device targeted configuration

For CSPs and policies that support per user configuration, the MDM server can send user targeted setting values to the device that a MDM-enrolled user is actively logged into. The device notifies the server of the login status via a device alert (1224) with Alert type = in DM pkg\#1.

The data part of this alert could be one of following strings:

-   user – the user that enrolled the device is actively logged in. The MDM server could send user specific configuration for CSPs/policies that support per user configuration
-   others – another user login but that user does not have an MDM account. The server can only apply device wide configuration, e.g. configuration applies to all users in the device.
-   none – no active user login. The server can only apply device wide configuration and available configuration is restricted to the device environment (no active user login).

Below is an alert example:

```
<Alert>
        <CmdID>1</CmdID>
        <Data>1224</Data>
        <Item>
            <Meta>
                <Type xmlns=”syncml:metinf”>com.microsoft/MDM/LoginStatus</Type>
                <Format xmlns=”syncml:metinf”>chr</Format>
            </Meta>
            <Data>user</Data>
        </Item>
    </Alert>
```

The server notifies the device whether it is a user targeted or device targeted configuration by a prefix to the management node’s LocURL, with ./user for user targeted configuration, or ./device for device targeted configuration. By default, if no prefix with ./device or ./user, it is device targeted configuration.

The following LocURL shows a per user CSP node configuration: **./user/vendor/MSFT/EnterpriseModernAppManagement/AppInstallation/&lt;PackageFamilyName&gt;/StoreInstall**

The following LocURL shows a per device CSP node configuration: **./device/vendor/MSFT/RemoteWipe/DoWipe**

## SyncML response status codes

When using SyncML in OMA DM, there are standard response status codes that are returned. The following table lists the common SyncML response status codes you are likely to see. For more information about SyncML response status codes, see section 10 of the [SyncML Representation Protocol](https://openmobilealliance.org/release/Common/V1_2_2-20090724-A/OMA-TS-SyncML-RepPro-V1_2_2-20090724-A.pdf) specification.

| 212         | Authentication accepted. Normally you'll only see this in response to the SyncHdr element (used for authentication in the OMA-DM standard). You may see this if you look at OMA DM logs, but CSPs do not typically generate this. |

| 401         | Invalid credentials. The requested command failed because the requestor must provide proper authentication. CSPs do not usually generate this error.                                                                              |
