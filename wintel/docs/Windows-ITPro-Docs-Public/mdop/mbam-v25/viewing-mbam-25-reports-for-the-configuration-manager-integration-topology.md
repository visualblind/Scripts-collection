# Viewing MBAM 2.5 Reports for the Configuration Manager Integration Topology


This topic describes the reports that are available when you configure Microsoft BitLocker Administration and Monitoring (MBAM) with the Configuration Manager Integration topology. The reports show BitLocker compliance for the enterprise and for individual computers and devices that MBAM manages. The reports provide tabular information and charts, and they have filters that let you view data from different perspectives.

In the Configuration Manager Integration topology, you view reports from Configuration Manager rather than from the Administration and Monitoring Website, with the exception of the **Recovery Audit Report**, which you continue to view from the Administration and Monitoring Website.

For information about MBAM reports for the Stand-alone topology, see [Viewing MBAM 2.5 Reports for the Stand-alone Topology](viewing-mbam-25-reports-for-the-stand-alone-topology.md).

## Description of reports in Configuration Manager


There are a few minor differences in the reports for the Configuration Manager Integration topology and the Stand-alone topology. The following sections describe the data in the MBAM reports for the Configuration Manager Integration topology:

-   [BitLocker Enterprise Compliance Dashboard](#bkmk-dashboard)

-   [BitLocker Enterprise Compliance Details](#bkmk-compliancedetails)

-   [BitLocker Enterprise Compliance Summary](#bkmk-compliancesummary)

-   [BitLocker Computer Compliance Report](#bkmk-compliancereport)

### <a href="" id="bkmk-dashboard"></a>BitLocker Enterprise Compliance Dashboard

The BitLocker Enterprise Compliance Dashboard provides the following graphs, which show BitLocker compliance status across the enterprise:

-   Compliance Status Distribution

-   Non Compliant Errors Distribution

-   Compliance Status Distribution by Drive Type

**Compliance Status Distribution**

This pie chart shows compliance status for computers within the enterprise. It also shows the percentage of computers, compared to the total number of computers in the selected collection, that has that compliance status. The actual number of computers with each status is also shown. The pie chart shows the following compliance statuses:

-   Compliant

-   Non Compliant

-   User Exempt

-   Temporary User Exempt

-   Policy Not Enforced

-   Unknown. These computers reported a status error, or they are part of the collection, but have never reported their compliance status. The lack of a compliance status could occur if the computer is disconnected from the organization.

**Non Compliant Errors Distribution**

This pie chart shows the categories of computers in the enterprise that are not compliant with the BitLocker Drive Encryption policy, and shows the number of computers in each category. Each category percentage is calculated from the total number of non-compliant computers in the collection.

-   User postponed encryption

-   Unable to find compatible TPM

-   System partition not available or large enough

-   Policy conflict

-   Waiting for TPM auto provisioning

-   An unknown error has occurred

-   No information. These computers do not have the MBAM Client installed, or they have the MBAM Client installed but not activated (for example, the service is not working).

**Compliance Status Distribution by Drive Type**

This bar chart shows the current BitLocker compliance status by drive type. The statuses are **Compliant** and **Non Compliant**. Bars are shown for fixed data drives and operating system drives. Computers that do not have a fixed data drive are included and show a value only in the **Operating System Drive** bar. The chart does not include users who have been granted an exemption from the BitLocker Drive Encryption policy or the No Policy category.

### <a href="" id="bkmk-compliancedetails"></a>BitLocker Enterprise Compliance Details

This report shows information about the overall BitLocker compliance across your enterprise for the collection of computers that is targeted for BitLocker use.

### <a href="" id="bkmk-compliancereport"></a>BitLocker Computer Compliance Report

Use this report type to collect information that is specific to a computer. The BitLocker Computer Compliance Report provides detailed encryption information about each drive on a computer (operating system and fixed data drives). It also provides an indication of the policy that is applied to each drive type on the computer. To view the details of each drive, expand the Computer Name entry.

**Note**  
The Removable Data Volume encryption status is not shown in this report.
