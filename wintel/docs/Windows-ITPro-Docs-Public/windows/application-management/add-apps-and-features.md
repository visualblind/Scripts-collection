# How to add apps and features to Windows 10
> Applies to: Windows 10

Windows 10 includes a range of [applications](apps-in-windows-10.md), from [system apps](apps-in-windows-10.md#system-apps) that support the operating system (like Settings) to ["provisioned" apps](apps-in-windows-10.md#provisioned-windows-apps) (like Feedback Hub) that are installed the first time you run Windows. We also provide additional apps and features, called Features on Demand (like language packs or handwriting recognition), that you can install at any time. If you're working in a managed environment (like at work, where you have an administrator who manages your systems and resources), your admin can use [Windows Update to install Features on Demand](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/manufacture/desktop/features-on-demand-v2--capabilities). If you're working on your own device, you can add apps and features from the Settings app.

Here's how you do that:

1. In the Search bar, search for "apps."
2. Select **Apps and features** in the results.
3. Select **Manage optional features**, and then select **Add a feature**.
4. Select the feature you want to add, like **XPS Viewer**, and then select **Install.**

And that's it. You can see the apps you have installed on the **Apps & features** page and the features on **Manage optional features**.

You can manage and uninstall apps and features from the same Settings page. Just select the app or feature, and then select **Uninstall**.
