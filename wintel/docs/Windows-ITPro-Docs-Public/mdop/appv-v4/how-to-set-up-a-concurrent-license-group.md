# How to Set Up a Concurrent License Group


You can use the following procedure in the Application Virtualization Server Management Console to set up a concurrent license group. When you set up a concurrent license group, you can limit access to applications to a specific number of concurrent users.

**To set up a concurrent license group**

1.  In the left pane of the Application Virtualization Server Management Console, right-click the **Application Licenses** node.

2.  Select **New Concurrent License**.

3.  Enter a name in the **Application License Group Name** field.

4.  Enter a value (in minutes) in the **License Expiration Warning** field.

5.  Click **Next**.

6.  Enter descriptive text in the **License Description** field.

7.  Enter a value in the **Concurrent License Quantity** field.

8.  Select the **Enabled** check box to enable the license.

9.  Select the **Expiration Date** check box (if you want to set an expiration date), and enter the expiration date or use the calendar utility to select a date.

10. If you need to associate a key with the license, enter the license key information in the **License Key** field.

11. Click **Finish**.
