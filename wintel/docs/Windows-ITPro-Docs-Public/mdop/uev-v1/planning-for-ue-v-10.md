# Planning for UE-V 1.0


The goal of deployment planning is to help you successfully and efficiently deploy Microsoft User Experience Virtualization (UE-V) so that it does not disrupt the user experience or the network. There are a number of different deployment configurations and prerequisites that you must consider before you create your deployment plan.
