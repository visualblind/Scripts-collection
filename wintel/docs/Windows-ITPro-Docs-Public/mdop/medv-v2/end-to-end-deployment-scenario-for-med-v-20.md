# End-to-End Deployment Scenario for MED-V 2.0


This sample scenario for Microsoft Enterprise Desktop Virtualization (MED-V) 2.0 helps you deploy the MED-V components in your enterprise by using multiple scenarios end-to-end. You can think of this sample scenario as a case study that helps put the individual scenarios and procedures in context.

This section provides basic information and directions for deploying MED-V components as an end-to-end solution in your enterprise.

## MED-V Deployment Step-by-step Scenario


The topics in this step-by-step scenario include the following:

-   [MED-V 2.0 Supported Configurations](med-v-20-supported-configurations.md) discusses the requirements that you must have to install and run Microsoft Enterprise Desktop Virtualization (MED-V) 2.0 in your environment. This topic specifies the operating system requirements, configuration requirements, and MED-V workspace requirements. This topic also includes localization information about the languages that MED-V 2.0 supports.

-   [MED-V 2.0 Deployment Overview](med-v-20-deployment-overview.md) discusses general information and instructions to help you install and deploy MED-V throughout your enterprise. The MED-V components are client-based and are delivered and managed by using your existing enterprise infrastructure and processes. This topic provides an overview of the MED-V solution that includes information about the MED-V installation files and the MED-V components that you deploy. This topic also provides a high-level overview of the MED-V installation and deployment process.

-   [Prepare the Deployment Environment for MED-V](prepare-the-deployment-environment-for-med-v.md) discusses how to prepare your environment for a MED-V 2.0 deployment. This section describes the prerequisites that are required for the MED-V environment, such as Microsoft Windows 7 and an Active Directory infrastructure in which you use Group Policy to provide centralized management and configuration of operating systems, applications, and users' settings. This section also describes the prerequisites that you must have for installing and deploying MED-V 2.0 throughout your enterprise, such as Windows Virtual PC and the required Windows Virtual PC update.

-   [Deploy the MED-V Components](deploy-the-med-v-components.md) discusses the different ways you can install all of the necessary installation files and MED-V components throughout your enterprise. To install and deploy MED-V, you typically follow these steps:

    1.  Install the **MED-V Workspace Packager** on the administrator computer that you will use to build the MED-V workspace packages. For more information, see [How to Install the MED-V Workspace Packager](how-to-install-the-med-v-workspace-packager.md).

    2.  Create and test your MED-V workspace packages. For more information, see [Create a MED-V Workspace Package](create-a-med-v-workspace-package.md) and [Testing the MED-V Workspace Package](testing-the-med-v-workspace-package.md).

    3.  Deploy MED-V throughout your enterprise by using your company’s existing method for deploying applications. For more information, see [Deploying the MED-V Workspace Package](deploying-the-med-v-workspace-package.md).
