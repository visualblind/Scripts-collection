# How to Cancel Loading of Virtual Applications from the Desktop Notification Area


From the desktop notification area, you can cancel the loading of applications into the cache. Applications are loaded one application at a time; the progress bar shows you the application name, the percentage of application loaded, and the number of applications already processed compared to the total number of the applications queued. You can cancel any application load in progress before it is 100% loaded. You can skip the loading of all remaining applications as well.

**To cancel loading applications**

1.  Right-click the Application Virtualization System icon in the notification area.

2.  Select **Cancel** and **Load All** from the pop-up menu.

3.  Click one of the following buttons in the **Microsoft App Virt - Confirm Cancel** dialog to achieve the desired results:

    1.  **Skip**—To skip the currently loading application.

    2.  **Skip All**—To skip all remaining applications.

    3.  **Continue**—To cancel the dialog box and continue loading applications.
