# Configure HoloLens using a provisioning package



[Windows provisioning](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/configuration/provisioning-packages/provisioning-packages) makes it easy for IT administrators to configure end-user devices without imaging. Windows Configuration Designer is a tool for configuring images and runtime settings which are then built into provisioning packages. 

Some of the HoloLens configurations that you can apply in a provisioning package: 
- Upgrade to Windows Holographic for Business
- Set up a local account
- Set up a Wi-Fi connection
- Apply certificates to the device

To create provisioning packages, you must install Windows Configuration Designer [from Microsoft Store](https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9nblggh4tx22) or [from the Windows Assessment and Deployment Kit (ADK) for WindowsÂ 10](https://developer.microsoft.com/windows/hardware/windows-assessment-deployment-kit). If you install Windows Configurations Designer from the Windows ADK, select **Configuration Designer** from the **Select the features you want to install** dialog box.

## Create a provisioning package for HoloLens using the HoloLens wizard

The HoloLens wizard helps you configure the following settings in a provisioning package:

- Upgrade to the enterprise edition

    >[!NOTE]
    >Settings in a provisioning package will only be applied if the provisioning package includes an edition upgrade license to Windows Holographic for Business or if [the device has already been upgraded to Windows Holographic for Business](hololens1-upgrade-enterprise.md).

- Configure the HoloLens first experience (OOBE)
- Configure Wi-Fi network 
- Enroll device in Azure Active Directory or create a local account
- Add certificates
- Enable Developer Mode

>[!WARNING]
>You must run Windows Configuration Designer on Windows 10 to configure Azure Active Directory enrollment using any of the wizards.

Provisioning packages can include management instructions and policies, customization of network connections and policies, and more. 

> [!TIP]
> Use the desktop wizard to create a package with the common settings, then switch to the advanced editor to add other settings, apps, policies, etc.


### Create the provisioning package

Use the Windows Configuration Designer tool to create a provisioning package.

1. Open Windows Configuration Designer (by default, %windir%\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\Assessment and Deployment Kit\Imaging and Configuration Designer\x86\ICD.exe).

2. Click **Provision HoloLens devices**.

   ![ICD start options](images/icd-create-options-1703.png)   

3. Name your project and click **Finish**. 

4. Read the instructions on the **Getting started** page and select **Next**. The pages for desktop provisioning will walk you through the following steps.
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
> When you build a provisioning package, you may include sensitive information in the project files and in the provisioning package (.ppkg) file. Although you have the option to encrypt the .ppkg file, project files are not encrypted. You should store the project files in a secure location and delete the project files when they are no longer needed.

6. The device will ask you if you trust the package and would like to apply it. Confirm that you trust the package.

7. You will see whether the package was applied successfully or not. If it failed, you can fix your package and try again. If it succeeded, proceed with OOBE.

>[!NOTE]
>If the device was purchased before August 2016, you will need to sign into the device with a Microsoft account, get the latest OS update, and then reset the OS in order to apply the provisioning package.

## Apply a provisioning package to HoloLens after setup

>[!NOTE]
>Windows 10, version 1809 only

On your PC:
1. Create a provisioning package as described at [Create a provisioning package for HoloLens using the HoloLens wizard](hololens-provisioning.md). 
2. Connect the HoloLens device via USB to a PC. HoloLens will show up as a device in File Explorer on the PC. 
3. Drag and drop the provisioning package to the Documents folder on the HoloLens. 

On your HoloLens: 
1. Go to **Settings > Accounts > Access work or school**. 
2. In **Related Settings**, select **Add or remove a provisioning package**.
3. On the next page, select **Add a package** to launch the file picker and select your provisioning package. If the folder is empty, make sure you select **This Device** and select **Documents**.

After your package has been applied, it will show in the list of **Installed packages**. To view package details or to remove the package from the device, select the listed package.

## What you can configure

Provisioning packages make use of configuration service providers (CSPs). If you're not familiar with CSPs, see [Introduction to configuration service providers (CSPs) for IT pros](https://technet.microsoft.com/itpro/windows/manage/how-it-pros-can-use-configuration-service-providers).

In Windows Configuration Designer, when you create a provisioning package for Windows Holographic, the settings in **Available customizations** are based on [CSPs that are supported in Windows Holographic](https://msdn.microsoft.com/windows/hardware/commercialize/customize/mdm/configuration-service-provider-reference#hololens). The following table describes settings that you might want to configure for HoloLens.

![Common runtime settings for HoloLens](images/icd-settings.png)

| Setting | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Certificates** | Deploy a certificate to HoloLens.  |
| **ConnectivityProfiles** | Deploy a Wi-Fi profile to HoloLens.   |
| **EditionUpgrade** | [Upgrade to Windows Holographic for Business.](hololens1-upgrade-enterprise.md)  |
| **Policies** | Allow or prevent developer mode on HoloLens. [Policies supported by Windows Holographic for Business](https://msdn.microsoft.com/windows/hardware/commercialize/customize/mdm/policy-configuration-service-provider#hololenspolicies) |

>[!NOTE]
>App installation (**UniversalAppInstall**) using a provisioning package is not currently supported for HoloLens.
