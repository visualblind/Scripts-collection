# Create a task sequence with Configuration Manager and MDT


**Applies to**

-   WindowsÂ 10

In this topic, you will learn how to create a Microsoft System Center 2012 R2 Configuration Manager task sequence with Microsoft Deployment Toolkit (MDT) integration using the MDT wizard. Creating task sequences in System Center 2012 R2 Configuration Manager requires many more steps than creating task sequences for MDT Lite Touch installation. Luckily, the MDT wizard helps you through the process and also guides you through creating the needed packages.

For the purposes of this topic, we will use two machines: DC01 and CM01. DC01 is a domain controller and CM01 is a machine running Windows Server 2012 R2 Standard, both of which are members of the domain contoso.com for the fictitious Contoso Corporation. For more details on the setup for this topic, please see [Deploy Windows 10 with the Microsoft Deployment Toolkit](deploy-windows-10-with-the-microsoft-deployment-toolkit.md).

## <a href="" id="sec02"></a>Edit the task sequence


After you create the task sequence, we recommend that you configure the task sequence for an optimal deployment experience. The configurations include enabling support for Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI), dynamic organizational unit (OU) allocation, computer replace scenarios, and more.

1.  On CM01, using the Configuration Manager Console, select **Task Sequences**, right-click **Windows 10 Enterprise x64 RTM** task sequence, and select **Edit**.

2.  In the **Install** group, select the **Set Variable for Drive Letter** action and configure the following:

    * OSDPreserveDriveLetter: True
    
    >[!NOTE]
    >If you don't change this value, your Windows installation will end up in E:\\Windows.

3.  In the **Post Install** group, select **Apply Network Settings**, and configure the Domain OU value to use the **Contoso / Workstations** OU (browse for values).

4.  In the **Post Install** group, disable the **Auto Apply Drivers** action. (Disabling is done by selecting the action and, in the **Options** tab, selecting the **Disable this step** check box.)

5.  After the disabled **Post Install / Auto Apply Drivers** action, add a new group name: **Drivers**.

6.  After the **Post Install / Drivers** group, add an **Apply Driver Package** action with the following settings:

    * Name: HP EliteBook 8560w

    * Driver Package: Windows 10 x64 - HP EliteBook 8560w

    * Options: Task Sequence Variable: Model equals HP EliteBook 8560w
    
    >[!NOTE]
    >You also can add a Query WMI condition with the following query: SELECT \* FROM Win32\_ComputerSystem WHERE Model LIKE '%HP EliteBook 8560w%'
    
    ![Driver package options](../images/fig27-driverpackage.png "Driver package options")
    
    *Figure 24. The driver package options*

7.  In the **State Restore / Install Applications** group, select the **Install Application** action.

8.  Select the **Install the following applications** option, and add the OSD / Adobe Reader XI - OSD Install application to the list.

    ![Add an application to the task sequence](../images/fig28-addapp.png "Add an application to the task sequence")

    *Figure 25. Add an application to the Configuration Manager task sequence*

9.  In the **State Restore** group, after the **Set Status 5** action, add a **Request State Store** action with the following settings:

    * Restore state from another computer

    * If computer account fails to connect to state store, use the Network Access account

    * Options: Continue on error

    * Options / Condition:
    
      * Task Sequence Variable
      
      * USMTLOCAL not equals True

10. In the **State Restore** group, after the **Restore User State** action, add a **Release State Store** action with the following settings:

    * Options: Continue on error

    * Options / Condition:
    
      * Task Sequence Variable
      
      * USMTLOCAL not equals True

11. Click **OK**.

>[!NOTE]
>The Request State Store and Release State Store actions need to be added for common computer replace scenarios.

 

## <a href="" id="sec03"></a>Move the packages


While creating the task sequence with the MDT wizard, a few operating system deployment packages were created. To move these packages to the OSD folder, take the following steps.

1.  On CM01, using the Configuration Manager Console, in the Software Library workspace, expand **Application Management**, and then select **Packages**.

2.  Select the **MDT** and **Windows 10 x64 Settings** packages, right-click and select **Move**.

3.  In the **Move Selected Items** dialog box, select the **OSD** folder, and click **OK**.
