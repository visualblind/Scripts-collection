# How to Reset the FileSystem Cache


Resetting the FileSystem cache is not something that should usually be necessary. However if you need to completely reset the FileSystem cache, perhaps for troubleshooting purposes, you can use the following procedure. Administrative rights are required to perform this action.

**To reset the FileSystem cache**

1.  Set the following registry value to 0 (zero):

    HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\SoftGrid\\4.5\\Client\\AppFS\\State

2.  Restart the computer.
