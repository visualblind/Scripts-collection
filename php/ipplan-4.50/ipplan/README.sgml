    <abstract>

      <para>IPplan is a free (GPL), web based, multilingual, IP address 
      management and tracking tool written in 
      <ulink url="http://www.php.net">php 4</ulink>, simplifying the 
      administration of your IP address space. IPplan goes beyond IP 
      address management including DNS administration, configuration 
      file management, circuit management (customizable via templates) 
      and storing of hardware information (customizable via templates). 
      IPplan can handle a single network or cater for multiple networks 
      and customers with overlapping address space. See the 
      introduction section for more.</para>

  <sect1 id="requirements">

    <title>Requirements</title>

    <para>IPplan requires a working web server installation. Currently 
    the <ulink url="http://httpd.apache.org">Apache</ulink> web server 
    is preferred, but php as an ISAPI or CGI module on IIS works too - 
    follow the appropriate installation instructions in the IPplan 
    directory (INSTALL-IIS+MSSQL). Apache works just fine on Windows 
    platforms too. For installing Apache on a Windows platform, follow 
    <ulink url="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/windows.html">
    these</ulink> instructions. Or you can use 
    <ulink url="http://www.appservnetwork.com/">AppServ</ulink> or 
    <ulink url="http://www.wampserver.com/en/index.php">
    WampServer</ulink> which are complete installation packages for 
    Apache, MySQL and PHP for Windows - just add IPplan by following 
    the installation instructions in the IPPLAN-WINDOWS file (part of 
    IPPlan).</para>

    <sect2 id="databases">

      <title>Databases</title>

      <para>IPplan requires a working database installation. The

      <para>The following may work, but are untested - Sybase. In fact, 
      any database that supports SQL99 compliant joins, in particular 
      LEFT JOIN, should work. See limitations section below for 
      more.</para>

      <para>The web scripting language <ulink url="http://www.php.net">
      php 4.1 or higher</ulink> must also be installed as a module in 
      Apache (NOT as a cgi). Php must have the preferred database 
      driver compiled in and enabled. See the respective web sites and 
      installation documents for more detail. IPplan works just fine 
      with a combination of the Apache web server and php on a Windows 
      platform - just read the relevant installation instructions for 
      Windows carefully.</para>

      <tip>

        <para>IPplan is also known to work in a distributed, replicated

  <sect1 id="modes">

    <title>Mode of operation</title>

    <para>There are two modes of operation, one can be classified as a 
    services company and the other as an ISP.</para>

    <sect2 id="mode-services">

      <title>Services company</title>

      <para>As a services company your primary use of IPplan will be to 
      manage individual IP address records and the address plan of one 
      or more customers.</para>

    </sect2>

    <sect2 id="mode-isp">

      <title>ISP</title>

      <para>In ISP mode, you will assign blocks of IP address space to 
      your customers. In this mode, you will not be concerned at all 
      with individual IP address records and how the customer breaks 
      down his assigned address space. When you operate as an ISP, you 
      may also generate SWIP/registrar entries, which are only useful 
      if you deal directly with ARIN or any other registrar. (SWIP is 
      enabled in the config.php file, see ARIN 
      <ulink url="http://www.arin.net/minutes/tutorials/swipit.htm">
      tutorial</ulink> for more details). All the relevant 
      SWIP/registrar information is entered when the customer is 
      created.</para>

      <para>When using this mode, I suggest creating a dummy customer 
      which holds all the allocated address space from your regional 
      registrar (ARIN?) already broken up into the various blocks that 
      you will eventually assign to your customers. All these blocks 
      should be called &quot;free&quot; to allow them to be found using 
      the &quot;Find free&quot; menu option. Once you are ready to 
      assign a block, create a new customer with all the relevant 
      SWIP/registrar information completed, go to your dummy customer 
      and move a block of address space to the newly created customer, 
      and finally generate a SWIP/registrar entry for the new block. In 
      this mode areas and ranges are not too relevant except for the 
      dummy customer (see concepts below). You may also need to create 
      a template for your registrar in the templates directory. If you 
      have done this, feel free to contribute it to IPplan.</para>

    </sect2>

  </sect1>

  <sect1 id="concepts">

    <title>Concepts</title>

    <para>The flow of address management is based on the creation of 
    areas, then ranges which belong to areas, and finally, subnets 
    which belong to ranges. Actually, only subnets are required, but on 
    large networks it makes logical sense to group the network into 
    areas to ease administration and to reduce routing updates on the 
    network. There is a jpeg drawing included with the distribution 
    that graphically shows these relationships. The methodology 
    employed borrows significantly from OSPF routing concepts which are 
    explained more fully 
    <ulink url="http://www.cisco.com/univercd/cc/td/doc/cisintwk/ito_doc/ospf.htm">
    here</ulink>.</para>

    <sect2 id="deployment">

      <title>Deployment strategy</title>

      <para>So in a new installation, first create the areas, then 
      create ranges adding them to areas, and finally create subnets. 
      Searching is now a simple matter of selecting an area which will 
      display all the ranges for the area, or selecting no area and 
      simply selecting a range from the total list of ranges, or simply 
      selecting a base network address.</para>

      <note>

        <para>Within a customer or autonomous system, no overlaps are 
        allowed. This follows standard IP address rules.</para>

      </note>

      <para>To handle challenges like NAT or other overlapping address 
      space, you will be required to create multiple autonomous 
      systems. See &apos;Searching&apos; below how to see information 
      across multiple autonomous systems.</para>

    </sect2>

    <sect2 id="linking">

      <title>Linking addresses</title>

      <para>IP address records can be linked together. This allows one 
      address or multiple addresses to reference another address or 
      addresses. Using this feature allows for the referencing of NATed 
      addresses or having a link to a loopback address of a device. 
      Linking is done on the IP address details page by completing the 
      &quot;Linked address&quot; field. Once the field is completed, 
      you can follow the link. The link also appears on subnet summary 
      pages.</para>

      <para>You can also link many addresses in one go by choosing 
      multiple addresses in the &quot;Select multiple addresses to do a 
      bulk change&quot; window, then completing the &quot;User&quot; 
      field as follows:</para>

      <programlisting>LNKx.x.x.x userinfo</programlisting>
      <para>The LNK identifier must be in uppercase, followed by 
      exactly one valid IP address with no spaces, then followed by an 
      optional space and user description. After the page is submitted, 
      the embedded LNK will vanish.</para>

      <note>

        <para>If the destination record of a linked address does not 
        exist, a record will automatically get created pointing back to 
        the source address, but only if the destination subnet exists. 
        This is to signal the &quot;Find Next Free&quot; address logic 
        of the subnet that the destination address is used.</para>

      </note>

    </sect2>

  </sect1>

  <sect1 id="admin">

    <title>Administration</title>

    <para>The access control is divided up into three layers and 
    revolves around the creation of groups:</para>

    <sect2 id="admin-user">

      <title>Admin user</title>

      <para>Firstly you will need to create users and groups using the 
      admin user defined in the config.php script. The admin user can 
      only be used on the admin pages. Once you are done with the admin 
      functions, you will be required to re-authenticate as one of the 
      newly created users as soon as you access functions on the main 
      index page.</para>

    </sect2>

    <sect2 id="customer-access">

      <title>Customer access</title>

      <para>When a customer is created, a group must be assigned to the 
      customer. This will be the customers admin group and all members 
      of this group can create and delete both subnets, ranges, areas 
      and individual IP address records for the customer.</para>

      <para>When the subnet is created, the creator will choose a 
      subnet admin group.</para>

    </sect2>

    <sect2 id="subnet-access">

      <title>Subnet access</title>

      <para>The users assigned to the group that has subnet access can 
      only modify individual IP records for that subnet.</para>

      <para>Initially I would create three groups, one group that can 
      create customers, one group that can create subnets, areas and 
      ranges, and another group which can only modify individual IP 
      records. Normally in large networks the people that modify IP 
      records are not the same people that administer routers and 
      configure the IP address space.</para>

      <para>If a group is set to see only a particular customer, the 
      same group needs to be used for all operations for the customer. 
      The side effect to this is that the users assigned to the group 
      have full access to the customer and can make any changes to the 
      customers data, including creating and deletion of subnets. This 
      is not ideal and will be changed in future.</para>

    </sect2>

    <sect2 id="g-a-b">

      <title>Group authority boundaries</title>

      <para>Areas of responsibility can be assigned to a group, thus 
      limiting what address space a group can create networks in. The 
      default behavior allows administration anywhere. Care should be 
      taken when using this feature as changing the boundaries at a 
      later stage may orphan some parts of the database and yield it 
      inaccessible.</para>

      <tip>

        <para>Bounds are also useful to create users that only have 
        read access to the IPplan information. Create a very 
        restrictive bound for the group the user belongs to outside 
        your normal address space.</para>

      </tip>

  <sect1 id="circuit">

    <title>Circuit administration, host configuration data and asset 
    information</title>

    <para>Using the template capability IPplan can be extended to 
    contain custom information about your site. You can add any number 
    of custom fields for your site. See the section on 
    &quot;Templates&quot; for further information.</para>

  </sect1>

  <sect1 id="file">

    <title>Device configuration file management</title>

    <para>Any number of files can be attached to individual IP records. 
    Using this feature, configuration data (text and binary, drawings 
    etc) for devices can be stored and managed by IPplan.</para>

  </sect1>

  <sect1 id="DNS">

    <title>DNS administration</title>

    <para>Both forward and reverse zones can be created via the web 
    interface. Zone domains are forward zones - there can be as many 
    forward zones as you like per customer. Each of these can be unique 
    or they can even overlap with other customers.</para>

    <para><emphasis>Forward Zones:</emphasis></para>

    <para>To create a forward zone, select a customer and select 
    &quot;Add a DNS zone&quot;. The next screen will allow you to enter 
    information for the new zone. The domain name must be entered as 
    must at least two nameservers.</para>

    <para>At this point you have the option of creating a new zone from 
    scratch, or importing an existing zone via a zone transfer. If you 
    do a zone transfer, the PRIMARY or SECONDARY DNS servers must be 
    directly contactable from the webserver on which IPplan is running. 
    If the DNS server is not contactable an error will be 
    returned.</para>

    <para>If a domain is created from scratch, the domain name must be 
    entered as must at least two upstream DNS servers. The DNS servers 
    are automatically entered for you if the customer record (created 
    via &quot;Create a new customer/autonomous system&quot;) contains 
    DNS servers. This is a good way to not have to manually add the DNS 
    servers for each new zone created. The DNS servers can be changed 
    and will be independent per zone created. At the bottom of the 
    Add/Edit screen is place to enter two zone file paths. In future 
    this can be used to determine where the zone must be saved or on 
    what DNS server the zone must be created - currently these fields 
    do nothing.</para>

    <para>The next step is to add individual records to the newly 
    created zone. Do this under the &quot;Zone DNS records&quot; main 
    menu function. Select the customer, select the domain and add a 
    host. The &quot;Host name&quot; refers to the left hand side of a 
    bind zone file, then the type (A, CNAME or MX - more types in 
    future) and the &quot;IP/Hostname&quot; refers to the right hand 
    side of the zone file. In future the screen will change depending 
    on the record type you select and more record types will be 
    possible. The sort order determines the placement of the record in 
    the zone and on the screen. This is a number and the default is 
    9999 or the end of the file. If you want to insert records between 
    other records, work out a numbering plan.</para>

    <para>In future this will be automatic with options to &quot;Insert 
    before&quot; and &quot;Insert after&quot;. Currently you can 
    renumber the values retaining the order of the entries.</para>

    <para><emphasis>Reverse zones:</emphasis></para>

    <para>To create reverse zones is very much like creating a forward 
    zone, except that there are no detail records. All that is required 
    is to create a starting address and mask. The actual reverse 
    records are extracted based on the start and mask from the IP 
    records when you create a subnet and add records to the subnet. The 
    field used is the host name field and all invalid information in 
    this field will be ignored with a warning.</para>

    <para>Once your forward and reverse zones are created, each time a 
    change is made you will be required to export the zone by clicking 
    on the &quot;Export zone&quot; option. The output generated is in 
    XML and must then be parsed using and XSLT processor into a format 
    compatible with your DNS server.</para>

  <sect1 id="registrars">

    <title>Dealing with registrars</title>

    <para>Registrars are interacted with by email. IPplan can manage 
    all the records and manage all the fields and data required to 
    generate the registrar updates, no matter what the registrar is 
    (ARIN, RIPE, APNIC etc). Before these functions will work, the 
    correct config variables need to be set - these include the 
    MAINTAINERID, REGISTRY, REGEMAIL etc. Only users belonging to the 
    customer admin group can send these updates. Additional fields can 
    be added to the IPplan display pages if required, and these fields 
    are also available to the registrar templates.</para>

    <para>To generate updates, the required registrar template is 
    selected. IPplan includes a limited number of templates, but these 
    are fully customizable and simple to create and modify - see the 
    section on &quot;Templates&quot; later in the manual. Once the 
    template is selected, the fields from the database are substituted 
    into the template file and the output is displayed on the screen. 
    The user then selects which updates should be sent to the 
    registrar. The selected updates are then sent via email and the 
    date the updates were sent are recorded in the IPplan 
    database.</para>

  <sect1 id="searching">

    <title>Searching</title>

    <para>Creating a special customer called &apos;All&apos; allows 
    searching for information across all the available 
    customer/autonomous systems using the &apos;Display subnet&apos; 
    function. This special customer can contain areas and ranges that 
    limit the scope of searches, just like normal customers. Using this 
    feature allows a user to see the entire network picture in one 
    view.</para>

    <tip>

      <para>When creating new subnets, it is also beneficial to create 
      unused subnets with a a description of either &apos;free&apos; or 
      &apos;spare&apos;. These can be searched for at a later stage 
      using the &apos;Find Free&apos; function.</para>

    </tip>

    <tip>

      <para>It may also be beneficial to give ASE (Autonomous System 
      External, networks not local to yours) a special handle like 
      EXTERNAL so that they can be searched for at a later stage. These 
      networks often appear in routing tables as static routes to third 
      parties (not via the Internet).</para>

    </tip>

    <sect2 id="individual">

      <title>Searching for individual address details</title>

      <para>Searching can also be done on individual addresses using 
      the &apos;Match any IP address in subnet&apos; option of the 
      &apos;Display subnet information&apos; option. This is useful for 
      finding which networks, either for a single customer, or for all 
      customers an IP address belongs to. Using this option makes it 
      easy to find the offending network in a complaint situation if 
      you are an ISP.</para>

      <para>If matching by IP address, you will automatically jump to 
      the IP address edit page if the search is unique and matches only 
      one subnet from one customer. If you use the &apos;All&apos; 
      customer you will need to click on the relevant customer network 
      you wish to work with.</para>

    <sect2 id="areas">

      <title>Searching areas and ranges</title>

      <para>You can also create areas and ranges to search across only 
      certain address space ranges. Areas are containers for ranges. 
      Selecting an area that has ranges attached will search only in 
      those ranges. Select an area and not selecting a range will 
      search across all the ranges in the area.</para>

      <note>

        <para>Areas with no attached ranges will not display in the 
        &quot;Area&quot; selection list until ranges are added to the

      <title>Importing using NMAP</title>

      <para>A typical application for this would be to obtain data for

      obtain the host info of all the addresses that are active on the

      NMAP parameters are:</para>

      <programlisting> -sP -oX output.xml</programlisting>
      <para>To speed up the process, you can add -n to not resolve host 
      names. The import process also understands the -O operating

    ip address record pages), and templates that then munipulate the 
    data contained in the IPplan databases to generate output for 
    various registrars. All of these templates are fully administrator

    <sect2 id="iptemplates">

      <title>Customer, Subnet and IP address templates</title>

      <para>The administrator can define a custom template in IPplan to 
      allow the addition of as many custom fields to the customer, 
      subnet and ip address record pages as the administrator wishes. 
      This functionality allows flexibility in the way data is added to 
      the database. Some uses for these templates include tracking 
      asset information or WAN circuit information, the management of 
      DHCP address space, dealing with additional and ever changing 
      registrar requirements.</para>

      <para>As mentioned there are different template files for the 
      customer, subnet and IP address pages. The template for each of 
      these pages has a different name:</para>

      <para>A sample template called iptemplate.xml.sample can be found 
      in the /ipplan/user directory.</para>

      <para>If a template called called iptemplate-network.xml exists, 
      then this template will be used for network addresses (the first 
      address of the subnet). This is useful to define subnet wide 
      information like VLAN id&apos;s, telco line numbers, router 
      configurations etc. If the iptemplate-network.xml does not exist, 
      then the iptemplate.xml template will be used for network

        <para>The template file must be surrounded with

  <sect1 id="poller">

    <title>External command line poller</title>

    <para>The poller allows you to periodically scan subnets for

    logged in the IPplan database and will appear on the display subnet 
    page. You can find the poller script in the IPplan contrib 
    directory.</para>

    <para>The scans are done using nmap, thus large networks can be 
    scanned rapidly. Subnets that are to be scanned get entered into a 
    plain text file, so maintenance is easy. Polling can be automated 
    by adding the poller to cron.</para>

    <para>Firstly, you will need to create a file containing a list of 
    networks/addresses that you would like to poll. The file is a text 
    file with one address per line in the any format that the nmap 
    command understands (type nmap -h for more info).</para>

      <programlisting>10.10.10.0/24 
10.10.11.* 
10.12.12.1</programlisting>
    </para>

    <para>Once you have created your file you will need to make sure 
    the poller is configured correctly. Edit the poller file and change 
    the path at the top to the correct place where the command line php 
    can be found on your system.</para>

    <para>You can find the location by typing</para>

    <para>

      <programlisting>which php</programlisting>
    </para>

    <para>Next make sure that nmap can be found. Type </para>

    <para>

      <programlisting>which nmap</programlisting>
    </para>

    <para>and either update the NMAP statement in the IPplan config.php 
    file, or uncomment the NMAP define at the top of ipplan-poller.php 
    and update to reflect the correct path to nmap. This define will 
    override whatever is in config.php allowing a different NMAP to be 
    used. You may also leave config.php blank to prevent scanning from 
    within the IPplan web frontend.</para>

    <para>Now run the ipplan-poller.php file with the -d option, or 
    navigate to the admin-&gt;maintenance page. This will dump a list

    <para>Finally run the poller again with the correct command line

    <para>If the configuration is correct and there are no errors, 
    there should be no output - the database is updated silently in the 
    background. Any address that was successfully polled will now have 
    a key in the &quot;Pol&quot; column on the IPplan display 
    pages.</para>

    <para>You can now add the above line to cron to scan certain 
    subnets periodically.</para>

    <note>

      <para>Security: You should use a different user and password to 
      access the database using the command line poller. I suggest 
      creating a user that can only SELECT, UPDATE and INSERT into the 
      ipaddr table, and SELECT from the base and customer tables. See 
      your database administrator or manual for more details.</para>

    <title>IP address request system</title>

    <para>IPplan has a request feature whereby users can request 
    individual IP addresses by completing a form. This form is then 
    submitted into the IPplan database and via email to an 
    administrator or help desk account for processing. When the 
    administrator processes the request, all outstanding requests for a 
    particular customer/AS will appear on the IP address modify screen. 
    The administrator picks the relevant address from the list and all 
    the fields are automatically completed with the request details. 
    The administrator can then change some of the fields details before 
    submitting. When the form is submitted, the request is 
    deleted.</para>

    <para>Up to 100 outstanding requests can be active at one time - 
    this is to prevent denial of service on the database as the request 
    page is not authenticated. Excess junk requests can be cleared via 
    an admin only option on the maintenance page.</para>

    <para>Request email addresses are set in the config file. The list 
    of visible customers/AS&apos;s that addresses can be requested for 
    are also set via config options. The default is that addresses can 
    be requested for all customers.</para>

    <title>Authentication schemes</title>

    <para>IPplan supports either its own internal authentication 
    scheme, or an external scheme based on the Apache webservers 
    authentication modules. To use an external scheme, change the 
    setting in the config.php file. Next, place the relevant .htaccess 
    file in the IPplan user subdirectory (/ipplan/user). Do not place 
    an equivalent file in the admin subdirectory as the admin account 
    cannot be overridden.</para>

    <important>

      <para>The relevant users requiring access to IPplan must still be 
      created via the IPplan admin interface, but no password 
      information is required as this is overridden by the external 
      authenticator.</para>

    </important>

    <para>If the user is removed from the external authenticators 
    database (ldap, radius etc), the user will no longer be able to log 
    in to IPplan even if the account still exists in IPplan. This 
    scheme only handles single signon and password changes, not single 
    point of administration.</para>

    <para>Make sure that the external authenticator only returns the 
    userid in the REMOTE_USER variable. Ldap (or auth_ldap) by default 
    will return the entire DN, but this can be configured to return 
    only the userid. Read the instructions in config.php carefully for 
    debug tips.</para>

    <para>External authentication was tested against SiteMinder and the 
    Apache <ulink url="http://www.rudedog.org/auth_ldap/">
    auth_ldap</ulink> module.</para>

    <warning>

      <para><emphasis>THE HTTP BASIC AUTHENTICATION SCHEME DOES NOT 
      ENCRYPT USER-IDS AND PASSWORDS TRANSMITTED TO THE WEBSERVER - IT 
      IS RECOMMENDED THAT IPPLAN IS INSTALLED ON AN SSL PROTECTED 
      WEBSERVER ON PRODUCTION SYSTEMS.</emphasis></para>

        <para>Note that you cannot place the IPplan directory behind

        with IPplan authentication. An alternate method would be to
