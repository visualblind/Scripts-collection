# Messaging (Windows Configuration Designer reference)

Use for settings related to Messaging and Commercial Mobile Alert System (CMAS).

>[!IMPORTANT]
>These settings are intended to be used only by manufacturers, mobile operators, and solution providers when configuring devices, and are not intended for use by administrators in the enterprise.

>[!NOTE]
>CMAS is now known as Wireless Emergency Alerts (WEA). 

## Applies to

| Setting   | Desktop editions | Mobile editions | Surface Hub | HoloLens | IoT Core |
| --- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| All settings |   | X |  |  |  |

## GlobalSettings 

### DisplayCmasLifo

Use this setting to change the order in which CMAS alert messages are displayed, from the default first in/first out (FIFO) message order to last in/first out (LIFO) message order.

If the phone receives at least one CMAS alert message which has not been acknowledged by the user, and another CMAS alert message arrives on the phone, partners can configure the order in which the newly received alert messages are displayed on the phone regardless of the service category of the alert. Users will not be able to change the message order once it has been set. 

If partners do not specify a value for this customization, the default FIFO display order is used. Users will be able to acknowledge the messages in the reverse order they were received.

When configured as **True**, you set a LIFO message order. When configured as **False**, you set a FIFO message order.

### EnableCustomLineSetupDialog

Enable this setting to allow custom line setup dialogs in the Messaging app.

### ExtractPhoneNumbersInStrings"

Set as **True** to tag any 5-or-more digit number as a tappable phone number.

### ShowSendingStatus

>[!NOTE]
>This setting is removed in Windows 10, version 1709.

Set **ShowSendingStatus** to **True** to display the sending status for SMS/MMS messages.

### VoicemailIntercept

Partners can define a filter that intercepts an incoming SMS message and triggers visual voicemail synchronization. The filtered message does not appear in the userâ€™s conversation list.

A visual voicemail sync is triggered by an incoming SMS message if the following conditions are met:

- The message sender value starts with the string specified in the SyncSender setting. The length of the specified values must be greater than 3 characters but less than 75 characters.

- The body of the message starts with the string specified in the SyncPrefix setting. The length of the specified values must be greater than 3 characters but less than 75 characters.

- Visual voicemail is configured and enabled. For more information, see [Visual voicemail](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/dn790032.aspx).

>[!NOTE]
>These settings are atomic, so both SyncSender and SyncPrefix must be set.
>
>The SyncSender and SyncPrefix values vary for each mobile operator, so you must work with your mobile operators to obtain the correct or required values.

Setting | Description
--- | ---
SyncPrefix | Specify a value for SyncPrefix that is greater than 3 characters but less than 75 characters in length. For networks that support it, this value can be the keyword for the SMS notification.
SyncSender | Specify a value for SyncSender that is greater than 3 characters but less than 75 characters in length. For networks that support it, this value can be a short code of the mailbox server that sends a standard SMS notification.



## PerSimSettings

SetCacheControlNoTransform | When set, proxies and transcoders are instructed not to change the HTTP header and the content should not be modified. A value of 1 or 0x1 adds support for the HTTP header Cache-Control No-Transform directive. When the SetCacheControlNoTransform``Value is set to 0 or 0x0 or when the setting is not set, the default HTTP header Cache-Control No-Cache directive is used.
ShowRequiredMonthlyTest | **True** enables devices to receive CMAS Required Monthly Test (RMT) messages and have these show up on the device. **False** disables devices from receiving CMAS RMT messages.
SIProtocols | Additional supported service indication protocol name.
SmscPanelDisabled | **True** disables the short message service center (SMSC) panel. 
SMStoSMTPShortCode | Use to configure SMS messages to be sent to email addresses and phone numbers. `0` disables sending SMS messages to SMTP addresses. `1` enables sending SMS messages to SMTP addresses.

The user agent profile XML file details a phoneâ€™s hardware specifications and media capabilities so that an MMS application server (MMSC) can return supported optimized media content to the phone. The user agent profile XML file is generally stored on the MMSC. There are two ways to correlate a user agent profile with a given phone:</br></br>- You can take the user agent string of the phone that is sent with MMS requests and use it as a hash to map to the user agent profile on the MMSC. The user agent string cannot be modified.</br>- Alternatively, you can directly set the URI of the user agent profile on the phone.</br></br>Set UAProf to the full URI of your user agent profile file. Optionally, you can also specify the custom user agent property name for MMS that is sent in the header by setting UAProfToken to either `x-wap-profile` or `profile`.
UAProfToken | You can specify a user agent profile to use on the phone for MMS messages. The user agent profile XML file details a phoneâ€™s hardware specifications and media capabilities so that an MMS application server (MMSC) can return supported optimized media content to the phone. The user agent profile XML file is generally stored on the MMSC. 
UseDefaultAddress | By default, the MMS transport sends an acknowledgement to the provisioned MMS application server (MMSC). However, on some networks, the correct server to use is sent as a URL in the MMS message. In that case, a registry key must be set, or else the acknowledgement will not be received and the server will continue to send duplicate messages. **True** enables some networks to correctly acknowledge MMS messages. **False** disables the feature.
UseInsertAddressToken | Use insert address token or local raw address.
UserAgentString | Set UserAgentString to the new user agent string for MMS in its entirely. By default, this string has the format WindowsPhoneMMS/MicrosoftMMSVersionNumber WindowsPhoneOS/OSVersion-buildNumber OEM-deviceName, in which the italicized text is replaced with the appropriate values for the phone.
UseUTF8ForUnspecifiedCharset | Some incoming MMS messages may not specify a character encoding. To properly decode MMS messages that do not specify a character encoding, you can set UTF-8 to decode the message. 
WapPushTechnology | For networks that require non-standard handling of single-segment incoming MMS WAP Push notifications, you can specify that MMS messages may have some of their content truncated and that they may require special handling to reconstruct truncated field values. `1` or `0x1` enables MMS messages to have some of their content truncated. `0` or `0x0` disables MMS messages from being truncated
