# Audit Kernel Object

**Applies to**
-   Windows 10
-   Windows Server 2016


Audit Kernel Object determines whether the operating system generates audit events when users attempt to access the system kernel, which includes mutexes and semaphores.

Only kernel objects with a matching system access control list ([SACL](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/aa374872(v=vs.85).aspx)) generate security audit events. The audits generated are usually useful only to developers.

Typically, kernel objects are given SACLs only if the AuditBaseObjects or AuditBaseDirectories auditing options are enabled.

The “[Audit: Audit the access of global system objects](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/jj852233.aspx)” policy setting controls the default SACL of kernel objects.

**Event volume**: High.
