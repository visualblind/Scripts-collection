# How to Move an Application Group


In the Application Virtualization Server Management Console, you can use the following procedure to move an application group, which enables you to arrange your applications to suit your operations. You also can group them so that you can change the properties of nested groups simultaneously.

**To move an application group**

1.  In the left pane of the Application Virtualization Server Management Console, expand **Applications** so that you can see the **Application** group you want to move.

2.  Right-click the group and choose **Move**.

3.  In the **Select Target** window, navigate to the application group under which you want to place this group.

4.  Click **OK**.

    The group, all its subgroups, and its existing applications now appear under the target group. This move does not change the properties of the group or its applications.

    **Note**  
    You can select and move multiple application groups simultaneously. In the right pane, use the **CTRL**-click or **Shift**-click key combinations to select more than one group.
