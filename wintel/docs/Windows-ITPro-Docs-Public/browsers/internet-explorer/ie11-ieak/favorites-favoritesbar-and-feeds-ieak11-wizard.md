# Use the Favorites, Favorites Bar, and Feeds page in the IEAK 11 Wizard
The **Favorites, Favorites Bar, and Feeds** page of the Internet Explorer Administration Kit (IEAK 11) Customization Wizard lets you add:

-   **Links.** Used so your employees can quickly connect with your important websites. These links can appear in the **Links** folder or on the **Favorites Bar**.

-   **Web Slices.** Used so your employees can subscribe to a section of a webpage, tracking information as it changes, such as for weather reports, stock prices, or the progress of an auction item.

-   **Feeds.** Used so your employees can quickly access your recommended RSS feeds. While you can’t import a folder of RSS feeds, you can add new links.

Although we provide default items in the **Favorites, Favorites Bar, and Feeds** area, you can remove any of the items, add more items, or add new folders and links as part of your custom package. The customizations you make on this page only apply to Internet Explorer for the desktop.

**To work with Favorites**

1.  To import your existing folder of links, pick **Favorites**, and then click **Import**.

2.  Go to your existing link folder, most likely in the `<system_drive>\Users\<user_name>\Favorites` folder, and then click **OK**.<p>
The links are imported and added to the **Favorites, Favorites Bar, and Feeds** page, beneath the **Favorites** folder.

3.  To add a new favorite link, pick **Favorites**, and then click **Add URL**.<p>
The **Details** box appears.

4.  Type the new link name in the **Name** box.

5.  Type the new URL in the **URL** box.

6.  Optionally, you can add a 16x16 pixel icon to your link by adding the location in the **Icon** box.

7.  Click **OK**.

8.  To add a new **Favorites** folder, pick **Favorites**, and then click **Add Folder**.<p>
The **Details** box appears.

9.  Type the folder name into the **Name** box, and then click **OK**.

10. Click **Edit** to change any of your new information, **Test URL** to test each of your links to make sure they go to the right place, or **Remove** to delete a **Favorites** item.

11. If you have multiple **Favorites** links, you can update their order in the list. Check the **Add to the top of the list** box, click the link you want to move, and then click **Move Up** or **Move Down**.

12. Check the **Disable IE Suggested Sites** box to disable the Suggested Sites feature. By turning this on, your employees won’t receive suggested sites based on the sites that they visit.

13. Continue with the next procedures in this topic to add additional **Favorites Bar** or **RSS Feeds** links, or you can click **Next** to go to the [Browsing Options](browsing-options-ieak11-wizard.md) page or **Back** to go to the [Accelerators](accelerators-ieak11-wizard.md) page.
