# Managing the Archive


In Advanced Group Policy Management (AGPM), as an AGPM Administrator (Full Control), you manage access to the archive and have the option to limit the number of versions of each Group Policy Object (GPO) stored in the archive. You can delegate access to GPOs in the archive at the domain level or GPO level. Additionally, you can back up the archive so that you may be able to recover it if a disaster occurs.

As an AGPM Administrator, you can export a GPO to a file, copy the file to another forest, and then import the GPO into a domain in that forest. Unlike an Editor, you can import policy settings from a GPO backup directly into a new controlled GPO when you create it. For information about how to export a GPO, see [Export a GPO to a File](export-a-gpo-to-a-file.md).
