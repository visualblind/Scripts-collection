# 6410(F): Code integrity determined that a file does not meet the security requirements to load into a process.

**Applies to**
-   Windows 10
-   Windows Server 2016


[Code Integrity](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dd348642(v=ws.10).aspx) is a feature that improves the security of the operating system by validating the integrity of a driver or system file each time it is loaded into memory. Code Integrity detects whether an unsigned driver or system file is being loaded into the kernel, or whether a system file has been modified by malicious software that is being run by a user account with administrative permissions. On x64-based versions of the operating system, kernel-mode drivers must be digitally signed.

This event generates due to writable [shared sections](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/cc307397.aspx) being present in a file image.

There is no example of this event in this document.
