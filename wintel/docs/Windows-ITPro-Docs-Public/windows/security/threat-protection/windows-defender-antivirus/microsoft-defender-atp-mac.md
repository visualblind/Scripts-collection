## How to install Microsoft Defender ATP for Mac

### Prerequisites

- Access to the Microsoft Defender Security Center portal
- Beginner-level experience in macOS and BASH scripting
- Administrative privileges on the device (in case of manual deployment)

### System requirements

> [!CAUTION]
> The three most recent major releases of macOS are supported. Beta versions of macOS are not supported.

After you've enabled the service, you may need to configure your network or firewall to allow outbound connections between it and your endpoints.

The following table lists the services and their associated URLs that your network must be able to connect to. You should ensure that there are no firewall or network filtering rules that would deny access to these URLs, or you may need to create an *allow* rule specifically for them.

| Service location                         | DNS record              |
| ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Common URLs for all locations            |  x.cp.wd.microsoft.com <br/> cdn.x.cp.wd.microsoft.com <br/> eu-cdn.x.cp.wd.microsoft.com <br/> wu-cdn.x.cp.wd.microsoft.com <br/> *.blob.core.windows.net <br/> officecdn-microsoft-com.akamaized.net |
| European Union                           | europe.x.cp.wd.microsoft.com |
| United Kingdom                           | unitedkingdom.x.cp.wd.microsoft.com |
| United States                            | unitedstates.x.cp.wd.microsoft.com |

Microsoft Defender ATP can discover a proxy server by using the following discovery methods:
- Web Proxy Auto-discovery Protocol (WPAD)
- Manual static proxy configuration

If a proxy or firewall is blocking anonymous traffic, make sure that anonymous traffic is permitted in the previously listed URLs.

To test that a connection is not blocked, open [https://x.cp.wd.microsoft.com/api/report](https://x.cp.wd.microsoft.com/api/report) and [https://cdn.x.cp.wd.microsoft.com/ping](https://cdn.x.cp.wd.microsoft.com/ping) in a browser.

If you prefer the command line, you can also check the connection by running the following command in Terminal:

```bash
$ curl -w ' %{url_effective}\n' 'https://x.cp.wd.microsoft.com/api/report' 'https://cdn.x.cp.wd.microsoft.com/ping'
```

The output from this command should be similar to the following:

> `OK https://x.cp.wd.microsoft.com/api/report`
>
> `OK https://cdn.x.cp.wd.microsoft.com/ping`

> [!CAUTION]
> We recommend that you keep [System Integrity Protection](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204899) (SIP) enabled on client machines. SIP is a built-in macOS security feature that prevents low-level tampering with the OS, and is enabled by default.
