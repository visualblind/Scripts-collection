# Accessibility (Surface Hub)

Microsoft Surface Hub has the same accessibility options as Windows 10.


## Default accessibility settings

The full list of accessibility settings are available to IT admins in the **Settings** app. The default accessibility settings for Surface Hub include:

| Accessibility feature | Default settings  |

| Magnifier             | Off               |
| High contrast         | No theme selected |
| Closed captions       | Defaults selected for Font and Background and window |
| Keyboard              | **On-screen Keyboard**, **Sticky Keys**, **Toggle Keys**, and **Filter Keys** are all off. |
| Mouse                 | Defaults selected for **Pointer size**, **Pointer color** and **Mouse keys**. |
| Other options         | Defaults selected for **Visual options** and **Touch feedback**. |

The accessibility feature Narrator is not available in the **Settings** app. By default, Narrator is turned off. To change the default settings for Narrator, perform the following steps using a keyboard and mouse.
