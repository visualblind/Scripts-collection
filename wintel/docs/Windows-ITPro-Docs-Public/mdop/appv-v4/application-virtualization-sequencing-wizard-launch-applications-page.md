# Application Virtualization Sequencing Wizard Launch Applications Page


Use the **Launch Applications** page of the App-V sequencing wizard to run applications so that the Sequencer can optimize the package for streaming and you can configure how the application should be initially started on target computers. The page contains the elements described in the following table.

<table>
