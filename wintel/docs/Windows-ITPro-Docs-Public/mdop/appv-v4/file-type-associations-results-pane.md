# File Type Associations Results Pane


The **File Type Associations Results** pane in the Application Virtualization Server Management Console displays a list of the available file type associations. Users can see a list of file type extensions and the applications to which they correspond.

Right-click any application extension to display a pop-up menu that contains the following elements.

<a href="" id="delete"></a>**Delete**  
Deletes the file name extension from the list.

<a href="" id="properties"></a>**Properties**  
Displays the **Properties** dialog box for the selected application extension. This dialog box has the following tabs:

-   **General** tab—Displays general information about the file type association, including the application icon and name.

    -   **Icon**—Displays the selected icon for the associated file type.

    -   **Extension**—Displays the extension for the file type.

    -   **File Type Description**—Displays a brief description of the file type. You can edit this field.

    -   **Open files with this application**—Enables you to choose an application from the drop-down list of available applications.

    -   **Action**—Displays a list of the available actions for the associated file type. You can add new actions, edit existing actions, set an action as a default, or delete actions.

    -   **Content Type**—Displays a description of the contents of the file type. If this field is left blank, the client will fill it.

    -   **Perceived Type**—Displays the kind of file type. You can select one of the options from the drop-down list or add your own.

    -   **Confirm open after download**—Select this check box to display a confirmation message after an application is loaded.

    -   **Always show extension**—Select this check box to specify that extensions should be shown even when the user requests that the system hide the extensions for known file types.
