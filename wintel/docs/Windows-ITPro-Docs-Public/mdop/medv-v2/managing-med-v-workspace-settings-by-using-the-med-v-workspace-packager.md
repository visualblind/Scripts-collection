# Managing MED-V Workspace Settings by Using the MED-V Workspace Packager


You can use the MED-V Workspace Packager to manage certain settings in the MED-V workspace.

**To manage settings in a MED-V workspace**

1. To open the **MED-V Workspace Packager**, click **Start**, click **All Programs**, click **Microsoft Enterprise Desktop Virtualization**, and then click **MED-V Workspace Packager**.

2. On the **MED-V Workspace Packager** main panel, click **Manage Settings**.

3. In the **Manage Settings** window, you can configure the following MED-V workspace settings:

   <table>
   <colgroup>
   <col width="50%" />
   <col width="50%" />
   </colgroup>
   <tbody>
   <tr class="odd">
   <td align="left"><p><strong>Start MED-V workspace</strong></p></td>
   <td align="left"><p>Choose whether to start the MED-V workspace at user logon, at first use, or to let the end user decide when the MED-V workspace starts.</p></td>
   </tr>
   <tr class="even">
   <td align="left"><p></p></td>
   <td align="left"><p>The MED-V workspace starts in one of two ways: either when the end user logs on or when they first perform an action that requires MED-V, such as opening a published application or entering a URL that requires redirection.</p>
   <p>You can either define this setting for the end user or let the end user control how MED-V starts.</p>
   <div class="alert">
   <strong>Note</strong><br/><p>If you specify that the end user decides, the default behavior they experience is that the MED-V workspace starts when they log on. They can change the default by right-clicking the MED-V icon in the notification area and selecting <strong>MED-V User Settings</strong>. If you define this setting for the end user, they cannot change the way in which MED-V starts.</p>
   </div>
   <div>

   </div></td>
   </tr>
   <tr class="odd">
   <td align="left"><p><strong>Networking</strong></p></td>
   <td align="left"><p>Select <strong>Shared</strong> or <strong>Bridged</strong> for your networking setting. The default is <strong>Shared</strong>.</p></td>
   </tr>
   <tr class="even">
   <td align="left"><p></p></td>
   <td align="left"><p><strong>Shared</strong> - The MED-V workspace uses Network Address Translation (NAT) to share the host&#39;s IP for outgoing traffic.</p>
   <p><strong>Bridged</strong> - The MED-V workspace has its own network address, typically obtained through DHCP.</p></td>
   </tr>
   <tr class="odd">
   <td align="left"><p><strong>Store credentials</strong></p></td>
   <td align="left"><p>Choose whether you want to store the end user credentials.</p></td>
   </tr>
   <tr class="even">
   <td align="left"><p></p></td>
   <td align="left"><p>The default behavior is that credential storing is disabled so that the end user must be authenticated every time that they log on.</p>
   <div class="alert">
   <strong>Important</strong><br/><p>Even though caching the end user’s credentials provides the best user experience, you should be aware of the risks involved.</p>
   <p>The end user’s domain credential is stored in a reversible format in the Windows Credential Manager. An attacker could write a program that retrieves the password and thus gain access to the user’s credentials. You can only lessen this risk by disabling the storing of end user credentials.</p>
   </div>
   <div>

   </div></td>
   </tr>
   </tbody>
   </table>



4. Click **Save as…** to save the updated configuration settings in the specified folder. MED-V creates a registry file that contains the updated settings. Deploy the updated registry file by using Group Policy. For more information about how to use Group Policy, see [Group Policy Software Installation](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=195931) (https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=195931).

   MED-V also creates a Windows PowerShell script in the specified folder that you can use to re-create this updated registry file.
