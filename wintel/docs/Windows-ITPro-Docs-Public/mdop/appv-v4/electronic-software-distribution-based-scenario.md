# Electronic Software Distribution-Based Scenario


If you plan to use an electronic software distribution (ESD) deployment scenario for your Microsoft Application Virtualization environment, it is important to understand the factors that go into and are affected by that decision. The topics in this section describe the ESD scenario and provide information about package delivery methods, transmission protocols, and external components that you will need to consider in your deployment strategy. You can also use the procedures in this section to complete your deployment, from the server configuration phase through the deployment verification phase.
