# Update Windows 10 in enterprise deployments


**Applies to**

- Windows 10
- Windows 10 Mobile

> **Looking for consumer information?** See [Windows Update: FAQ](https://support.microsoft.com/help/12373/windows-update-faq) 

Windows as a service provides a new way to think about building, deploying, and servicing the Windows operating system. The Windows as a service model is focused on continually providing new capabilities and updates while maintaining a high level of hardware and software compatibility. Deploying new versions of Windows is simpler than ever before: Microsoft releases new features two to three times per year rather than the traditional upgrade cycle where new features are only made available every few years. Ultimately, this model replaces the need for traditional Windows deployment projects, which can be disruptive and costly, and spreads the required effort out into a continuous updating process, reducing the overall effort required to maintain Windows 10 devices in your environment. In addition, with the Windows 10 operating system, organizations have the chance to try out “flighted” builds of Windows as Microsoft develops them, gaining insight into new features and the ability to provide continual feedback about them.

>[!TIP]
>Windows servicing is changing, but for disaster recovery scenarios and bare-metal deployments of Windows 10, you still can use traditional imaging software such as System Center Configuration Manager or the Microsoft Deployment Toolkit. Using these tools to deploy Windows 10 images is similar to deploying previous versions of Windows.
>With each release of a new feature update for CB, Microsoft makes available new .iso files for use in updating your custom images. Each Windows 10 build has a finite servicing lifetime, so it’s important that images stay up to date with the latest build. For detailed information about how to deploy Windows 10 to bare-metal machines or to upgrade to Windows 10 from previous builds of Windows, see [Deploy Windows 10 with System Center 2012 R2 Configuration Manager](../deploy-windows-sccm/deploy-windows-10-with-system-center-2012-r2-configuration-manager.md). Additionally, Windows 10 clients can move from any supported version of Windows 10 (i.e. Version 1511) to the latest version directly (i.e 1709).
