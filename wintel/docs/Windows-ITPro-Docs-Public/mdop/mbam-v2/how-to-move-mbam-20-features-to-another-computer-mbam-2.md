# How to Move MBAM 2.0 Features to Another Computer


This topic describes the steps that you should take to move one or more Microsoft BitLocker Administration and Monitoring (MBAM) features to a different computer. When moving more than one Microsoft BitLocker Administration and Monitoring feature, you should move them in the following order:

1.  Recovery Database

2.  Compliance and Audit Database

3.  Compliance and Audit Reports

4.  Administration and Monitoring

## Moving the Recovery Database


To move the Recovery Database from one computer to another (for example, from Server A to Server B), use the following procedure.

1.  Stop all instances of the Administration and Monitoring web site.

2.  Run MBAM Setup on Server B.

3.  Back up the MBAM Recovery Database on Server A.

4.  Move the MBAM Recovery Database from Server A to B.

5.  Restore the MBAM Recovery Database on Server B.

6.  Configure access to the MBAM Recovery Database on Server B.

7.  Update the database connection data on MBAM Administration and Monitoring servers.

8.  Resume all instances of the MBAM Administration and Monitoring website.

**Stop All Instances of the MBAM Administration and Monitoring Website**

1.  On each of the servers running the MBAM Administration and Monitoring feature, use the Internet Information Services (IIS) Manager console to stop the MBAM website, which is named **Microsoft BitLocker Administration and Monitoring**.

2.  To automate this procedure, you can use Windows PowerShell to enter command line that is similar to the:

    `PS C:\> Stop-Website “Microsoft BitLocker Administration and Monitoring”`

    **Note**  
    To run this PowerShell command line, the IIS Module for PowerShell must be added to current instance of PowerShell. In addition, you must update the PowerShell execution policy to enable execution of scripts.



**Run MBAM Setup on Server B**

1.  Run MBAM Setup on Server B and select only the **Recovery Database** for installation.

2.  To automate this procedure, you can use Windows PowerShell to enter command line that is similar to the following:

    `PS C:\> MbamSetup.exe /qn I_ACCEPT_ENDUSER_LICENSE_AGREEMENT=1 AddLocal=KeyDatabase ADMINANDMON_MACHINENAMES=$DOMAIN$\$SERVERNAME$$ RECOVERYANDHWDB_SQLINSTANCE=$SERVERNAME$\$SQLINSTANCENAME$ TOPOLOGY=$X$`

    **Note**  
    Replace the following values in the example above with those that match your environment:

    -   $SERVERNAME$\\$SQLINSTANCENAME$ - Enter the name of the server and instance to which the Recovery Database will be moved.

    -   $DOMAIN$\\$SERVERNAME$ - Enter the domain and server names of each MBAM Administration and Monitoring Server that will contact the Recovery Database. Use a semi-colon to separate each domain and server pairs in the list (for example, $DOMAIN\\SERVERNAME$;$DOMAIN\\$SERVERNAME$$). Each server name must be followed by a “$” symbol, as shown in the example (MyDomain\\MyServerName1$; MyDomain\\MyServerName2$).

    -   $X$ - Enter **0** if you are installing the MBAM Stand-alone topology, or **1** if you are installing the MBAM Configuration Manager topology.



**Back Up the Recovery Database on Server A**

1.  To back up the Recovery Database on Server A, use SQL Server Management Studio and the Task named Back Up. By default, the database name is **MBAM Recovery Database**.

2.  To automate this procedure, create a SQL file (.sql) that contains the following SQL script:

    Modify the MBAM Recovery Database to use the full recovery mode.

    ```sql
    USE master;

    GO

    ALTER DATABASE "MBAM Recovery and Hardware"

       SET RECOVERY FULL;

    GO

    -- Create MBAM Recovery Database Data and MBAM Recovery logical backup devices.

    USE master

    GO

    EXEC sp_addumpdevice 'disk', 'MBAM Recovery and Hardware Database Data Device',

    'Z:\MBAM Recovery Database Data.bak';

    GO

    -- Back up the full MBAM Recovery Database.

    BACKUP DATABASE [MBAM Recovery and Hardware] TO [MBAM Recovery and Hardware Database Data Device];

    GO

    BACKUP CERTIFICATE [MBAM Recovery Encryption Certificate]

    TO FILE = 'Z:\SQLServerInstanceCertificateFile'

    WITH PRIVATE KEY

    (

        FILE = ' Z:\SQLServerInstanceCertificateFilePrivateKey',

        ENCRYPTION BY PASSWORD = '$PASSWORD$'

    );

    GO
    ```

    **Note**  
    Replace the following values in the example above with those that match your environment:

    -   $PASSWORD$ - Enter a password that you will use to encrypt the Private Key file.



3.  Run the SQL File by using SQL Server PowerShell and a command line that is similar to the following:

    `PS C:\> Invoke-Sqlcmd -InputFile 'Z:\BackupMBAMRecoveryandHardwarDatabaseScript.sql' -ServerInstance $SERVERNAME$\$SQLINSTANCENAME$`

    **Note**  
    Replace the following values in the example above with those that match your environment:

    -   $SERVERNAME$\\$SQLINSTANCENAME$ - Enter the name of the server and instance from which the Recovery Database will be backed up.



**Move the Recovery Database and Certificate from Server A to Server B**

1.  Move the following file from Server A to Server B by using Windows Explorer.

    -   MBAM Recovery Database data.bak

2.  To move the certificate for the encrypted database, use the following automation steps. To automate this procedure, you can use Windows PowerShell to enter a command line that is similar to the following:

    `PS C:\> Copy-Item “Z:\MBAM Recovery Database Data.bak” \\$SERVERNAME$\$DESTINATIONSHARE$`

    `PS C:\> Copy-Item “Z:\SQLServerInstanceCertificateFile” \\$SERVERNAME$\$DESTINATIONSHARE$`

    `PS C:\> Copy-Item “Z:\SQLServerInstanceCertificateFilePrivateKey” \\$SERVERNAME$\$DESTINATIONSHARE$`

    **Note**  
    Replace the following value in the example above with those that match your environment:

    -   $SERVERNAME$ - Enter the name of the server to which the files will be copied.

    -   $DESTINATIONSHARE$ - Enter the name of the share and path to which the files will be copied.



**Restore the Recovery Database on Server B**

1.  Restore the Recovery Database on Server B by using SQL Server Management Studio and the task named **Restore Database**.

2.  Once the task has been completed, select the database backup file by selecting the **From Device** option and then use the **Add** command to select the MBAM Recovery database **Data.bak** file.

3.  Select **OK** to complete the restoration process.

4.  To automate this procedure, create a SQL file (.sql) that contains the following-SQL script:

    ```sql
    -- Restore MBAM Recovery Database. 

    USE master

    GO

    -- Drop certificate created by MBAM Setup.

    DROP CERTIFICATE [MBAM Recovery Encryption Certificate]

    GO

    --Add certificate

    CREATE CERTIFICATE [MBAM Recovery Encryption Certificate]

    FROM FILE = 'Z: \SQLServerInstanceCertificateFile'

    WITH PRIVATE KEY

    (

        FILE = ' Z:\SQLServerInstanceCertificateFilePrivateKey',

        DECRYPTION BY PASSWORD = '$PASSWORD$'

    );

    GO

    -- Restore the MBAM Recovery Database data and log files.

    RESTORE DATABASE [MBAM Recovery and Hardware]

       FROM DISK = 'Z:\MBAM Recovery Database Data.bak'

       WITH REPLACE
    ```

    **Note**  
    Replace the following values in the example above with those that match your environment:

    -   $PASSWORD$ - Enter a password that you used to encrypt the Private Key file.



5.  You can use Windows PowerShell to enter a command line that is similar to the following:

**Configure Access to the Databases**

1.  On the server or servers where the Recovery Database and Compliance and Audit Database are deployed, use the Local user and Groups snap-in from Server Manager to add the computer accounts from each server that is running the MBAM Administration and Monitoring Server feature to the local groups named **MBAM Recovery and Hardware DB Access** (Recovery DB Server) and **MBAM Compliance Status DB Access** (Compliance and Audit Database Server).

2.  To automate this procedure, you can use Windows PowerShell to enter a command line, that is similar to the following, on the server where the Compliance and Audit Database was deployed.

    `PS C:\> net localgroup "MBAM Compliance Auditing DB Access" $DOMAIN$\$SERVERNAME$$  /add`

3.  On the server where the Recovery database was deployed, you can use Windows PowerShell to enter a command line that is similar to the following:

    `PS C:\> net localgroup "MBAM Recovery and Hardware DB Access" $DOMAIN$\$SERVERNAME$$  /add`

    **Note**  
    Replace the following value in the example above with the applicable values for your environment:

    -   $DOMAIN$\\$SERVERNAME$$ - Enter the domain and machine name of the Administration and Monitoring Server. The server name must be followed by a “$” symbol, as shown in the example (for example, MyDomain\\MyServerName1$).

    -   $DOMAIN$\\$REPORTSUSERNAME$ - Enter the user account name that was used to configure the data source for the Compliance and Audit Reports.



~~~
The command lines that are listed for adding server computer accounts to the MBAM local groups must be run for each Administration and Monitoring Server that will be accessing the databases in your environment.
