# Surface Asset Tag Tool

Surface Asset Tag is a command line interface (CLI) utility
that allows you to view, assign, and modify an assigned asset tag value
for Surface devices. It works on Surface Pro 3 and all newer Surface devices.

## System requirements

- Surface Pro 3 or later

- UEFI firmware version 3.9.150.0 or later

## Using Surface Asset Tag 

To run Surface Asset Tag:

1.  On the Surface device, download **Surface Asset Tag.zip** from the [Microsoft Download
    Center](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=46703),
    extract the zip file, and save AssetTag.exe in desired folder (in
    this example, C:\\assets).

2.  Open a command console as an Administrator and run AssetTag.exe,
    entering the full path to the tool.

3.  Restart Surface.

### Asset Tag tool commands   
In the following examples, AssetTag.exe is saved in a directory on a local machine (C:\assets). 

To get the proposed asset tag, run AssetTag -g.

**Example**

   ```
 C:\assets\AssetTag.exe -g
  ```
 
 To clear the proposed asset tag, run AssetTag -s.
 
 **Example**
 
   ```
C:\assets\AssetTag.exe -s
  ```
To set the proposed asset tag, run AssetTag -s testassettag12.

**Example**

```
C:\assets\AssetTag.exe -s testassettag12
```

>[!NOTE]
>The asset tag value must contain between 1 and 36 characters. Valid characters include A-Z, a-z, 0-9, period (.) and hyphen (-).


## Managing asset tags

You can view the existing asset tag in the UEFI settings under Device
Information (**Control Panel > Recovery > Advanced Startup > Restart
now**.)

The figure below shows the results of running the Asset Tag Tool on
Surface Go.

Alternately, you can use WMI to query the existing asset tag on a device:

(Get-WmiObject -query “Select * from Win32_SystemEnclosure”)

**Example**

   ```
C:\Windows\System32> (Get-WmiObject -query “Select * from Win32_SystemEnclosure”)
  ```
  
### Using PowerShell

You can use the script below as a way of getting the proposed value and
interpreting any errors.

 ```
AssetTag -g \> $asset\_tag 2\> $error\_message  
$asset\_tag\_return\_code = $LASTEXITCODE  
$asset\_tag = $asset\_tag.Trim(“\`r\`n”)

if ($asset\_tag\_return\_code -eq 0) {  
Write-Output (“Good Tag = ” + $asset\_tag)  
} else {  
Write-Output (  
“Failure: Code = ” + $asset\_tag\_return\_code +  
“Tag = ” + $asset\_tag +  
“Message = ” + $error\_message)

}
 ```
