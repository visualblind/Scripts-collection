### URL Redirection

### Event ID 5005

Couldn’t get VM name from configuration; can’t launch guest browser.

<a href="" id="description"></a>**Description**

<a href="" id="solution"></a>**Solution**  
Ensure that the MED-V workspace name is set and that it matches a virtual machine name in the C:\\Users\\&lt;*user*&gt;\\Virtual Machines directory. The MED-V workspace name is located at HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Medv\\v2\\VM\\Name.

For example, if the user is "Matt" and the workspace name is "mattsworkspace", the value of HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Medv\\v2\\VM\\Name should be "mattsworkspace", and there should be a file that is named C:\\Users\\Matt\\Virtual Machines\\mattsworkspace.vcmx.

### Event ID 5006

Failed to create pipe server.

<a href="" id="description"></a>**Description**  
The URL Redirection service could not create the pipe server to communicate with Internet Explorer.

<a href="" id="solution"></a>**Solution**

### ConfigMgr (Guest)

### Event ID 7001

The host network configuration data is not properly formatted.

<a href="" id="description"></a>**Description**  
Either the network configuration received from the host is an incorrectly formatted XML string, or the network information returned from the host cannot be written to an XML document.

<a href="" id="solution"></a>**Solution**  
Restart the host computer and the virtual machine.

### Event ID 7005

A change to the host network configuration was detected, but was not able to be applied because the host network configuration data was not properly formatted.

<a href="" id="description"></a>**Description**  
A change to the host network configuration was communicated to the virtual machine, but could not be processed in the virtual machine because of an error. This error could be caused by incorrectly formatted data or the inability to set the information into the Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) CCMNetworkAdapter instance.

<a href="" id="solution"></a>**Solution**  
Restart the host and virtual machine.

### ConfigMgr (Host)

### Event ID 8006

Reinstall the virtual machine.

### Event ID 8008

The workstation's network configuration information could not be retrieved.

<a href="" id="description"></a>**Description**  
Network configuration information could not be collected from the MED-V host, most likely because of a system call failure in the .NET Framework. This failure can also occur if the network information returned from the MED-V host cannot be written to an XML document.

<a href="" id="solution"></a>**Solution**  
Restart the host workstation.

### Event ID 8010

The network configuration data could not be set in the virtual machine.

<a href="" id="description"></a>**Description**  
The MED-V host network address translation (NAT) could not be communicated to the virtual machine, most likely because the virtual machine is in a bad state or the Windows Virtual PC Additions were not installed or enabled.

<a href="" id="solution"></a>**Solution**  
Shut down and restart the virtual machine. In addition, you might have to reinstall the virtual machine.

### Event ID 8011

The network configuration data could not be reset in the virtual machine.

<a href="" id="description"></a>**Description**  
The MED-V host network configuration (BRIDGED) could not be communicated to the virtual machine, most likely because the virtual machine is in a bad state or the Windows Virtual PC Additions were not installed or enabled.

<a href="" id="solution"></a>**Solution**  
Shut down and restart the virtual machine. In addition, you might have to reinstall the virtual machine.

### Printer Redirection

<a href="" id="description"></a>**Description**  
The end user is not authorized to access the folder required to open or create the MED-V printer file for reading.

<a href="" id="solution"></a>**Solution**  
Verify that the User\\AppData\\ path can be accessed and that the user has permission to read and write to it. For example, if the user is "Matt", the path C:\\Users\\Matt\\AppData\\, and all files therein should have Read and Write permissions. And if it exists, the path C:\\Users\\Matt\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\MEDV\\v2\\ and all files therein should have Read and Write permissions.

### Event ID 9002

File Permission Error.

<a href="" id="description"></a>**Description**  
The end user is not authorized to access the folder required to open or create the MED-V printer file for writing.

<a href="" id="solution"></a>**Solution**  
Ensure that the User\\AppData\\ path can be accessed, and that the user has permission to read and write to it. For example, if the user is "Matt", the path C:\\Users\\Matt\\AppData\\ and all files therein should have Read and Write permissions. And if it exists, the path C:\\Users\\Matt\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\MEDV\\v2\\ and all files therein should have Read and Write permissions.

### Event ID 9004

Could not create path for storing MEDV printer files.

<a href="" id="description"></a>**Description**  
The printer redirection service could not access files or create directories required for storing the printer information.

<a href="" id="solution"></a>**Solution**  
Verify that the User\\AppData\\ path can be accessed and that the user has permission to read and write to it. For example, if the user is "Matt", the path C:\\Users\\Matt\\AppData\\ and all files therein should have Read and Write permissions. And if it exists, the path C:\\Users\\Matt\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\MEDV\\v2\\ and all files therein should have Read and Write permissions.

### Event ID 9005

Couldn’t get VM name from configuration; cannot launch guest installer. Cannot update MED-V – No host network detected.

<a href="" id="description"></a>**Description**  
The printer redirection service was not able to obtain the MED-V workspace name from the MED-V configuration and cannot inform Windows Virtual PC to start the installer on the MED-V guest.

<a href="" id="solution"></a>**Solution**  
Ensure that the MED-V workspace name is set and that it matches a virtual machine name in the C:\\Users\\&lt;*user*&gt;\\Virtual Machines directory. The MED-V workspace name is located at HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Medv\\v2\\VM\\Name.

For example, if the user is "Matt" and the workspace name is "mattsworkspace", the value of HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Medv\\v2\\VM\\Name should be "mattsworkspace" and there should be a file that is named C:\\Users\\Matt\\Virtual Machines\\mattsworkspace.vcmx.
