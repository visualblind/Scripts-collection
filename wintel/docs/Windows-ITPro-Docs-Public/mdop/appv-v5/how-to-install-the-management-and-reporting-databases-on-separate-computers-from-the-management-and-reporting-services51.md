# How to Install the Management and Reporting Databases on Separate Computers from the Management and Reporting Services


Use the following procedure to install the database server and management server on different computers. The computer you plan to install the database server on must be running a supported version of Microsoft SQL or the installation will fail.

**Note**  
After you complete the deployment, the **Microsoft SQL Server name**, **instance name** and **database name** will be required by the administrator installing the service to be able to connect to these databases.



**To install the management database and the management server on separate computers**

1.  Copy the App-V 5.1 server installation files to the computer on which you want to install it on. To start the App-V 5.1 server installation right-click and run **appv\_server\_setup.exe** as an administrator. Click **Install**.

2.  On the **Getting Started** page, review and accept the license terms, and click **Next**.

    If you are using a custom SQL Server instance, then select **Use a custom instance** and type the name of the instance.

    If you are using a custom database name, then select **Custom configuration** and type the database name.

7.  On the next **Create New Management Server Database** page, select **Use a remote computer**, and type the remote machine account using the following format: **Domain\\MachineAccount**.

    **Note**  
    If you plan to deploy the management server on the same computer you must select **Use this local computer**.

**To install the management and reporting databases using App-V 5.1 database scripts**

1.  Copy the App-V 5.1 server installation files to the computer on which you want to install it on.

2.  To extract the App-V 5.1 database scripts, open a command prompt and specify the location where the installation files are saved and run the following command:

    **appv\_server\_setup.exe** **/LAYOUT** **/LAYOUTDIR=”InstallationExtractionLocation”**.

3.  After the extraction has been completed, to access the App-V 5.1 database scripts and instructions readme file:

    -   The App-V 5.1 Management Database scripts and instructions readme are located in the following folder: **InstallationExtractionLocation** \\ **Database Scripts** \\ **Management Database**.

    -   The App-V 5.1 Reporting Database scripts and instructions readme are located in the following folder: **InstallationExtractionLocation** \\ **Database Scripts** \\ **Reporting Database**.

4.  For each database, copy the scripts to a share and modify them following the instructions in the readme file.

    **Note**  
    For more information about modifying the required SIDs contained in the scripts see, [How to Install the App-V Databases and Convert the Associated Security Identifiers by Using PowerShell](how-to-install-the-app-v-databases-and-convert-the-associated-security-identifiers--by-using-powershell51.md).



5.  Run the scripts on the computer running Microsoft SQL Server.
