# Getting Started with MBAM 2.0


Microsoft BitLocker Administration and Monitoring (MBAM) 2.0 requires thorough planning before you deploy it or use its features. Because this product can affect every computer in your organization, you might disrupt your entire network if you do not plan your deployment carefully. However, if you plan your deployment carefully and manage it so that it meets your business requirements, BitLocker Administration and Monitoring 2.0 can help reduce your administrative overhead and total cost of ownership.

If you are new to this product, we recommend that you read the documentation carefully. To get the MBAM software, see [How Do I Get MDOP?](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=322049). Before you deploy MBAM to a production environment, we also recommend that you validate your deployment plan in a test environment. You might also consider taking a class about relevant technologies. For more information about Microsoft training opportunities, see the Microsoft Training Overview at <https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=80347>.

This section of the MBAM 2.0 Administrator’s Guide includes high-level information about MBAM 2.0 to provide a basic understanding of the product before you begin to plan deployment. For specific information about deploying MBAM with the Configuration Manager integrated topology, see [Using MBAM with Configuration Manager](using-mbam-with-configuration-manager.md). You can find additional MBAM documentation on the Microsoft BitLocker Administration and Monitoring (MBAM) Documentation Resources Download Page at <https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=258391>.
