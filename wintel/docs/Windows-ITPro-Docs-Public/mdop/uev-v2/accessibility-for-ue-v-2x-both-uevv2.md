# Accessibility for UE-V 2.x


Microsoft is committed to making its products and services easier for everyone to use. This section provides information about features and services that make this product and its corresponding documentation more accessible for people with disabilities.

## Access any command with a few keystrokes


You can access most commands by using two keystrokes. To use an access key:

1.  Press Alt.

    The keyboard shortcuts are displayed over each feature that is available in the current view.

2.  Press the letter that is shown in the keyboard shortcut over the feature that you want to use.

### Documentation in alternative formats

If you have difficulty reading or handling printed materials, you can obtain the documentation for many Microsoft products in more accessible formats. You can view an index of accessible product documentation on the Microsoft Accessibility website. In addition, you can obtain additional Microsoft publications from Learning Ally, formerly known as Recording for the Blind & Dyslexic, Inc. Learning Ally distributes these documents to registered, eligible members of their distribution service.

For information about the availability of Microsoft product documentation and books from Microsoft Press, use the following contact.
