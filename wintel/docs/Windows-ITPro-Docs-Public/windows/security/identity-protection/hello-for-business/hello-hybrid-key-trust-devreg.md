You are ready to configure device registration for your hybrid environment. Hybrid Windows Hello for Business deployment needs device registration to enable proper device authentication.   

> [!NOTE]
> Before proceeding, you should familiarize yourself with device registration concepts such as:
> * Azure AD registered devices
> * Azure AD joined devices
> * Hybrid Azure AD joined devices
>
> You can learn about this and more by reading [Introduction to Device Management in Azure Active Directory.](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/device-management-introduction)

## Configure Azure for Device Registration
Begin configuring device registration to support Hybrid Windows Hello for Business by configuring device registration capabilities in Azure AD. 

To do this, follow the **Configure device settings** steps under [Setting up Azure AD Join in your organization](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/active-directory-azureadjoin-setup/)  

Next, follow the guidance on the [How to configure hybrid Azure Active Directory joined devices](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/devices/hybrid-azuread-join-manual) page. In the **Configuration steps** section, identify your configuration at the top of the table (either **Windows current and password hash sync** or **Windows current and federation**) and perform only the steps identified with a check mark.
