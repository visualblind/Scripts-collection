# How to Use the Administration and Monitoring Website


The Administration and Monitoring Website, also referred to as the Help Desk, is an administrative interface for BitLocker Drive Encryption. Use the website to review reports, recover end users’ drives, and manage end users’ TPMs, as described in the following sections.

**Note**  
If you are using MBAM in the Stand-alone topology, you view all reports from the Administration and Monitoring Website. If you are using the Configuration Manager Integration topology, you view all reports in Configuration Manager, except the Recovery Audit report, which you continue to view from the Administration and Monitoring Website. For more information about reports, see [Monitoring and Reporting BitLocker Compliance with MBAM 2.5](monitoring-and-reporting-bitlocker-compliance-with-mbam-25.md).

 

## Required roles for using the Administration and Monitoring Website


To access specific areas of the Administration and Monitoring Website, you must have one of the following roles, which are groups that you create in Active Directory. You can use any name for these groups.

<table>
<colgroup>
<col width="50%" />
<col width="50%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th align="left">Account</th>
<th align="left">Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="left"><p>MBAM Advanced Helpdesk Users</p></td>
<td align="left"><p>Provides access to all areas of the Administration and Monitoring Website. Users who have this role enter only the recovery key, and not the end user’s domain and user name, when helping end users recover their drives. If a user is a member of both the MBAM Helpdesk Users group and the MBAM Advanced Helpdesk Users group, the MBAM Advanced Helpdesk Users group permissions override the MBAM Helpdesk Users Group permissions.</p>
<p></p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td align="left"><p>MBAM Helpdesk Users</p></td>
<td align="left"><p>Provides access to the Manage TPM and Drive Recovery areas of the Administration and Monitoring Website. Individuals who have this role must fill in all fields, including the end-user’s domain and account name, when they use either area.</p>
<p>If a user is a member of both the MBAM Helpdesk Users group and the MBAM Advanced Helpdesk Users group, the MBAM Advanced Helpdesk Users group permissions override the MBAM Helpdesk Users Group permissions.</p></td>

<tr class="odd">
<td align="left"><p>MBAM Report Users</p></td>
<td align="left"><p>Provides access to the reports in the <strong>Reports</strong> area of the Administration and Monitoring Website.</p></td>
