# Configure Windows Hello for Business

**Applies to**
-   WindowsÂ 10, version 1703 or later
-   Hybrid deployment
-   Certificate trust

 
Your environment is federated and you are ready to configure your hybrid environment for Windows Hello for business using the certificate trust model.  
> [!IMPORTANT]
> If your environment is not federated, review the [New Installation baseline](hello-hybrid-cert-new-install.md) section of this deployment document to learn how to federate your environment for your Windows Hello for Business deployment.  

The configuration for Windows Hello for Business is grouped in four categories.  These categories are: 
* [Active Directory](hello-hybrid-cert-whfb-settings-ad.md)
* [Public Key Infrastructure](hello-hybrid-cert-whfb-settings-pki.md)
* [Active Directory Federation Services](hello-hybrid-cert-whfb-settings-adfs.md)
* [Group Policy](hello-hybrid-cert-whfb-settings-policy.md)

For the most efficient deployment, configure these technologies in order beginning with the Active Directory configuration
