# How to Move an Application


If you have application groups under the **Applications** node in the Application Virtualization Server Management Console, you can move an application between groups or from the main node to a group. You can move the applications to suit your operations. You also can group them so that you can change the properties of nested groups simultaneously.

**Important**  
You must have one or more application groups under the **Applications** node to move applications.

 

**To move an application**

1.  In the left pane of the Application Virtualization Server Management Console, expand **Applications**.

2.  Highlight the application you want to move.

3.  Right-click the application and choose **Move**.

4.  In the **Select Target** window, navigate to the group in which you want to place this group.

5.  Click **OK**.

    The applications now appear under the target group. This move does not change the properties of the group or its applications, and it does not move any of the application's files on the server.

    **Note**  
    You can select and move multiple application groups simultaneously. In the right pane, use the **CTRL**-click or **Shift**-click key combinations to select more than one group.
