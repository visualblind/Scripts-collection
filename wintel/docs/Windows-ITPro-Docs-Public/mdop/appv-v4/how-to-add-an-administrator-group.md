# How to Add an Administrator Group


From the **Administrators** node of the Application Virtualization Server Management Console, you can use the following procedure to add an administrator group.

**To add an administrator group**

1.  In the left pane of the Application Virtualization Server Management Console, right-click the **Administrators** node and select **Add Administrator Group**.

2.  Complete the **Select Groups** dialog box to add groups.

    **Important**  
    When completing the **Select Groups** dialog box, you might see the **Multiple Names Found** dialog box, which can display multiple group names. To add more than one group at a time, press **Ctrl** and click the name of each group you want to add. Click **OK** to exit the **Multiple Names Found** dialog box.

     

3.  Click **OK**.

    **Note**  
    To add administrator groups to the Application Virtualization Management Server, you must have system administrator or security administrator privileges on the associated data store. If you attempt to create a group without sufficient privileges, the system generates an error message.
