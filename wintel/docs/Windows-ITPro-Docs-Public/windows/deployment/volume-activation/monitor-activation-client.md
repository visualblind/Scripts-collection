You can monitor the success of the activation process for a computer running Windows in several ways. The most popular methods include:
- Using the Volume Licensing Service Center website to track use of MAK keys.
- Using the **Slmgr /dlv** command on a client computer or on the KMS host. (For a full list of options, see [Slmgr.vbs Options](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/ff793433.aspx).)
- Viewing the licensing status, which is exposed through Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI); therefore, it is available to non-Microsoft or custom tools that can access WMI. (Windows PowerShell can also access WMI information.)
- Most licensing actions and events are recorded in the Event log (ex: Application Log events 12288-12290).
- Microsoft System Center Operations Manager and the KMS Management Pack can provide insight and information to users of System Center Operations Manager.
- See [Troubleshooting activation error codes](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-server/get-started/activation-error-codes) for information about troubleshooting procedures for Multiple Activation Key (MAK) or the Key Management Service (KMS).
- The VAMT provides a single site from which to manage and monitor volume activations. This is explained in the next section.
