examples of this project can be seen at http://soulreactor.com

This is a "quick release" meaning the code might a bit messy.

This project was born out the desire to see if I could write a bot that 
connects to a filesharing network with an undocumented protocol via PHP.
This represents a lot of work at the beginning of 2004 making a protocol
analyzer that works from a map file so I can extend it to work with any
protocol I need (think ICQ etc..)

It was written quite a while ago, but I decided to release this because it
may come in handy for some people attempting to connect PHP and manage
protocols which there is very very little online about.

in the examples directions are four files which each have directions in their
headers. In order to run the "soulbot" in that directory you will need to 
create a mysql database named "soul_soul" and paste in the contents of
db_schema.sql into phpmyadmin or via command line. If you want to change the 
name of the database, just go through those files and replace 'soul_soul' with
whatever the name of your db is, I didn't set it up so that the db prefix is
defined as I sometimes run multiple instances of the bot from various machines
to maximize the output.

you will need to make changes in the config.php to reflect your mysql settings
and if you don't like my bot naming scheme you probably want to change that
as well.

The files protocol.php and protomap.php are the two files that define how this
particular protocol works, protomap.php it can be pretty easily modified to work 
with other protocols.

If you do anything great with this, let me know.

Cheers.
