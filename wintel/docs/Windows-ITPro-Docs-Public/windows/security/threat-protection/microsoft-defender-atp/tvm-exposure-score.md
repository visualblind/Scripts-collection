# Exposure score
**Applies to:**
- [Microsoft Defender Advanced Threat Protection (Microsoft Defender ATP)](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2069559)

Your exposure score reflects how vulnerable your organization is to cybersecurity threats. Low exposure score means your machines are less vulnerable from exploitation. 

The widget also gives you a high-level view of your exposure score trend over time. Any spikes in the chart gives you a visual indication of a high cybersecurity threat exposure that you can investigate further.

## How it works

Several factors affect your organization exposure score: 
- Weakness discovered on the device
- Likelihood of a device getting breached
- Value of the device to the organization
- Relevant alert discovered on the device

Reduce the exposure score by addressing what needs to be remediated based on the prioritized security recommendations. See [Security recommendations](tvm-security-recommendation.md) for details.
