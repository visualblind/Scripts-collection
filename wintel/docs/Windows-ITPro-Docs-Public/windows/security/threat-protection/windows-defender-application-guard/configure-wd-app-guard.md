# Configure Windows Defender Application Guard policy settings

**Applies to:** [Microsoft Defender Advanced Threat Protection (Microsoft Defender ATP)](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2069559)

Windows Defender Application Guard (Application Guard) works with Group Policy to help you manage your organization's computer settings. By using Group Policy, you can configure a setting once, and then copy it onto many computers. For example, you can set up multiple security settings in a GPO, which is linked to a domain, and then apply all those settings to every computer in the domain.

Application Guard uses both network isolation and application-specific settings.

## Network isolation settings

These settings, located at **Computer Configuration\Administrative Templates\Network\Network Isolation**, help you define and manage your company's network boundaries. Application Guard uses this information to automatically transfer any requests to access the non-corporate resources into the Application Guard container.

>[!NOTE]
>You must configure either the Enterprise resource domains hosted in the cloud or Private network ranges for apps settings on your employee devices to successfully turn on Application Guard using enterprise mode. 

>Proxy servers must be a neutral resource listed in the "Domains categorized as both work and personal" policy.

|Enterprise resource domains hosted in the cloud|At least Windows Server 2012, Windows 8, or Windows RT|A pipe-separated (\|) list of your domain cloud resources. Included endpoints are rendered using Microsoft Edge and won't be accessible from the Application Guard environment.

|Domains categorized as both work and personal|At least Windows Server 2012, Windows 8, or Windows RT|A comma-separated list of domain names used as both work or personal resources. Included endpoints are rendered using Microsoft Edge and will be accessible from the Application Guard and regular Edge environment. Note: This list supports the wildcards detailed in the [Network isolation settings wildcards](#network-isolation-settings-wildcards) table.|
