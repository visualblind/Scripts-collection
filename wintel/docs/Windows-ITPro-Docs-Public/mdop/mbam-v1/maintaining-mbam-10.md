# Maintaining MBAM 1.0


After you complete all the necessary planning and then deploy Microsoft BitLocker Administration and Monitoring (MBAM), you can configure MBAM to run in a highly available fashion while using it to manage enterprise BitLocker encryption operations. The information in this section describes high availability options for MBAM, as well as how to move MBAM Server features if necessary.

## MBAM Management Pack


The Microsoft System Center Operations Manager Management Pack for MBAM is available for download from the Microsoft Download Center.

This management pack monitors the critical interactions in the server-side infrastructure, such as the connections between the web services and databases and the operational calls between websites and their supportive web service. It also uploads the requests between desktop clients and their respective receiving web service endpoints.

## Ensure high availability for MBAM 1.0


MBAM is designed to be fault-tolerant. If a server becomes unavailable, the users should not be negatively affected. The information in this section can be used to configure a highly available MBAM installation.
