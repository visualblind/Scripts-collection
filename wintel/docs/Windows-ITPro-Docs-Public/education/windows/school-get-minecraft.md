# For IT administrators - get Minecraft: Education Edition

**Applies to:**

-   Windows 10  

When you sign up for a [Minecraft: Education Edition](https://education.minecraft.net) trial, or purchase a [Minecraft: Education Edition](https://education.minecraft.net) subscription. Minecraft will be added to the inventory in your Microsoft Store for Education which is associated with your Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant. Your Microsoft Store for Education is only displayed to members of your organization.

>[!Note]
>If you don't have an Azure AD or Office 365 tenant, you can set up a free Office 365 Education subscription when you request Minecraft: Education Edition. For more information see [Office 365 Education plans and pricing](https://products.office.com/academic/compare-office-365-education-plans).

## Settings for Office 365 A3 or Office 365 A5 customers

Schools that purchased these products have an extra option for making Minecraft: Education Edition available to their students:
- Office 365 A3 or Office 365 A5
- Enterprise Mobility + Security E3 or Enterprise Mobility + Security E5
- Minecraft: Education Edition

If your school has these products in your tenant, admins can choose to enable Minecraft: Education Edition for students using Office 365 A3 or Office 365 A5. On your Office 365 A3 or Office 365 A5 details page in **Microsoft Store for Education**, under **Settings & actions**, you can select **Allow access to Minecraft: Education Edition for users of Office 365 A3 or Office 365 A5**. 

When this setting is selected, students in your tenant can use Minecraft: Education Edition even if they do not have a trial or a direct license assigned to them. 

If you turn off this setting after students have been using Minecraft: Education Edition, they will have 25 more days to use Minecraft: Education Edition before they do not have access.

### Configure automatic subscription assignment

For Minecraft: Education Edition, you can use auto assign subscription to control whether or not you assign a subscription when a member of your organization signs in to the app. When auto assign subscription is on, people from your organization who don’t have a subscription will automatically get one when they sign in to Minecraft: Education Edition. When auto assign subscription is off, people from your organization will get the trial version when they sign in to Minecraft: Education Edition. This allows you to control which people use the trial version, and which people are assigned a full subscription. You can always reassign subscriptions, but planning ahead will reduce time spent managing apps and subscriptions. By default, automatic subscription assignment is turned on.

**How to turn off automatic subscription assignment**

> [!Note]
> The version of the Minecraft: Education Edition page in the Microsoft Store will be different depending on which Microsoft Store for Education flight you are using. 

1. Sign in to [Microsoft Store for Education](https://educationstore.microsoft.com)

**To download for others**</br>

    ![Microsoft Store app showing access to My Library](images/mc-dnld-others-teacher.png)

3. **Save to USB drive**. After you've extracted the files, save the Minecraft: Education Edition folder to a USB drive, or to a network location that you can access from each PC.  
4. **Install app**. Use the USB drive to copy the Minecraft folder to each Windows 10 PC where you want to install Minecraft: Education Edition. Open Minecraft: Education Edition folder, right-click **InstallMinecraftEducationEdition.bat** and click **Run as administrator**.

<!--- ### Access to Microsoft Store for Business
By default, when a teacher with a work or school account acquires Minecraft: Education Edition, they are automatically signed up for Window Store for Business, and the **Basic Purchaser** role is assigned to them. **Basic Purchaser** role allows teachers to acquire Minecraft: Education Edition and to distribute it to students. 

However, tenant admins can control whether or not teachers automatically sign up for Microsoft Store for Business, and get the **Basic Purchaser** role. You can configure this with the **Allow educators in my organization to sign up for the Microsoft Store for Business.** You'll find this on the **Permissions** page. 

To prevent educators from automatically signing up for Microsoft Store for Business
1.  In Microsoft Store for Business, click **Settings**, and then click **Permissions**.

-->

<!--- ## <a href="" id="private-store"></a>Private store

When you create you Microsoft Store for Business account, you'll have a set of apps included for free in your private store. Apps in your private store are available for all people in your organization to install and use. 

These apps will automatically be in your private store:
- Word mobile
- Excel mobile
- PowerPoint mobile
- OneNote
- Sway
- Fresh Paint
- Minecraft: Education Edition

As an admin, you can remove any of these apps from the private store if you'd prefer to control how apps are distributed. --> 

<!--- ## Need more copies of Minecraft: Education Edition?
You can purchase more licenses by working with your channel partner. Licenses are available at a lower rate than the price for individual copies that are available through Microsoft Store for Business. Individual copies are also available through Microsoft Store for Business. 

If you’ve purchased a volume license, be sure to let other basic purchasers in your organization know about the volume license. That should help prevent unnecessary purchases of individual copies. -->
