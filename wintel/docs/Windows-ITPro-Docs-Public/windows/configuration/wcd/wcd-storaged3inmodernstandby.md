# StorageD3InModernStandby (Windows Configuration Designer reference)

Use **StorageD3InModernStandby** to enable or disable low power state (D3) during standby. When this setting is configured to **Enable Storage Device D3**, SATA and NVMe devices will be able to enter the D3 state when the system transits to modern standby state, if they are using a Microsoft inbox driver such as StorAHCI, StorNVMe.
