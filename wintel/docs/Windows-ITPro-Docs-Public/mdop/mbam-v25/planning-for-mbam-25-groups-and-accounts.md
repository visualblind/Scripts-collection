# Planning for MBAM 2.5 Groups and Accounts


This topic lists the roles and accounts that you must create in Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) to provide security and access rights for the Microsoft BitLocker Administration and Monitoring (MBAM) databases, reports, and web applications. For each role and account, the corresponding field in the MBAM Server Configuration wizard is provided. For a list of Windows PowerShell cmdlets and parameters that correspond to these accounts, see [Configuring MBAM 2.5 Server Features by Using Windows PowerShell](configuring-mbam-25-server-features-by-using-windows-powershell.md#bkmk-reqd-posh-accts).

**Note**  
MBAM does not support the use of managed service accounts.



## Database accounts


Create the following accounts for the Compliance and Audit Database and the Recovery Database.
