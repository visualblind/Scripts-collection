# Using the App-V 5.1 Client Management Console


This topic provides information about how you can configure and manage the Microsoft Application Virtualization (App-V) 5.1 client.

## Modify App-V 5.1 client configuration


The App-V 5.1 client has associated settings that can be configured to determine how the client will run in your environment. You can manage these settings on the computer that runs the client or by using PowerShell or Group Policy. For more information about how to modify the client using PowerShell or Group Policy configuration see, [How to Modify Client Configuration by Using PowerShell](how-to-modify-client-configuration-by-using-powershell51.md).

You can obtain information about the App-V 5.1 client or perform specific tasks by using the App-V 5.1 client management console. Many of the tasks that you can perform in the client management console you can also perform by using PowerShell. The associated PowerShell cmdlets for each action are also displayed in the following table. For more information about how to use PowerShell, see [Administering App-V 5.1 by Using PowerShell](administering-app-v-51-by-using-powershell.md).

The client management console contains the following described main tabs.

<table>

<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="left"><p>Overview</p></td>
<td align="left"><p>The <strong>Overview</strong> tab contains the following elements:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Update – Use the <strong>Update</strong> tile to refresh a virtualized application or to receive a new virtualized package.</p>
<p>The <strong>Last Refresh</strong> displays the current version of the virtualized package.</p></li>
<li><p>Download all virtual applications – Use the <strong>Download</strong> tile to download all of the packages provisioned to the current user.</p>
<p>(Associated PowerShell cmdlet: <strong>Mount-AppvClientPackage</strong>)</p>
<p></p></li>
<li><p>Work Offline – Use this tile to disallow all automatic and manual virtual application updates.</p>
<p>(Associated PowerShell cmdlet: <strong>Set-AppvPublishServer –UserRefreshEnabled –GlobalRefreshEnabled</strong>)</p></li>
</ul></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td align="left"><p>Virtual Apps</p></td>
<td align="left"><p>The <strong>VIRTUAL APPS</strong> tab displays all of the packages that have been published to the user.
