# BitLocker frequently asked questions (FAQ)

**Applies to**
-   Windows 10

This topic links to frequently asked questions about BitLocker. BitLocker is a data protection feature that encrypts drives on your computer to help prevent data theft or exposure. BitLocker-protected computers can also delete data more securely when they are decommissioned because it is much more difficult to recover deleted data from an encrypted drive than from a non-encrypted drive.
