# Testing scenarios for Windows Information Protection (WIP)
**Applies to:**

- Windows 10, version 1607 and later
- Windows 10 Mobile, version 1607 and later

We've come up with a list of suggested testing scenarios that you can use to test Windows Information Protection (WIP) in your company.

## Testing scenarios
You can try any of the processes included in these scenarios, but you should focus on the ones that you might encounter in your organization.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>If any of these scenarios does not work, first take note of whether WIP has been revoked. If it has, unenlightened apps will have to be uninstalled and re-installed since their settings files will remain encrypted.

            <ol>
                <li>Open File Explorer, right-click a work document, and then click <strong>Work</strong> from the <strong>File Ownership</strong> menu.<br>Make sure the file is encrypted by right-clicking the file again, clicking <strong>Advanced</strong> from the <strong>General</strong> tab, and then clicking <strong>Details</strong> from the <strong>Compress or Encrypt attributes</strong> area. The file should show up under the heading, <strong>This enterprise domain can remove or revoke access:</strong> <em>&lt;your_enterprise_identity&gt;</em>. For example, contoso.com.</li>
                <li>In File Explorer, right-click the same document, and then click <strong>Personal</strong> from the <strong>File Ownership</strong> menu.<br>Make sure the file is decrypted by right-clicking the file again, clicking <strong>Advanced</strong> from the <strong>General</strong> tab, and then verifying that the <strong>Details</strong> button is unavailable.</li>
            </ol>
            <strong>For mobile:</strong><br><br>
            <ol>

                <li>Click the elipsis (...) again, click <strong>File ownership</strong> from the drop down menu, and then click <strong>Work</strong>.<br>Make sure the file is encrypted, by locating the <strong>Briefcase</strong> icon next to the file name.</li>
                <li>Select the same file, click <strong>File ownership</strong> from the drop down menu, and then click <strong>Personal</strong>.<br>Make sure the file is decrypted and that you&#39;re no longer seeing the <strong>Briefcase</strong> icon next to file name.</li>
