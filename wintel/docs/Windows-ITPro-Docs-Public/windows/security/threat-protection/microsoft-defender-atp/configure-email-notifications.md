# Configure alert notifications in Microsoft Defender ATP

**Applies to:**
- [Microsoft Defender Advanced Threat Protection (Microsoft Defender ATP)](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2069559)


>Want to experience Microsoft Defender ATP? [Sign up for a free trial.](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/windows/microsoft-defender-atp?ocid=docs-wdatp-emailconfig-abovefoldlink)

You can configure Microsoft Defender ATP to send email notifications to specified recipients for new alerts. This feature enables you to identify a group of individuals who will immediately be informed and can act on alerts based on their severity.

> [!NOTE]
> Only users with 'Manage security settings' permissions can configure email notifications. If you've chosen to use basic permissions management, users with Security Administrator or Global Administrator roles can configure email notifications.

You can set the alert severity levels that trigger notifications. You can also add or remove recipients of the email notification. New recipients get notified about alerts encountered after they are added. For more information about alerts, see [View and organize the Alerts queue](alerts-queue.md).

If you're using role-based access control (RBAC), recipients will only receive notifications based on the machine groups that were configured in the notification rule.
Users with the proper permission can only create, edit, or delete notifications that are limited to their machine group management scope.
Only users assigned to the Global administrator role can manage notification rules that are configured for all machine groups.

The email notification includes basic information about the alert and a link to the portal where you can do further investigation.
