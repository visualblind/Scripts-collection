# How to Exit the App-V Client from the Notification Area


You can use the following procedure to exit the Application Virtualization Desktop Client or Client for Remote Desktop Services.

**To exit the client**

-   Right-click the Application Virtualization System icon in the notification area, and select **Exit** from the pop-up menu.

    If you choose to exit from the client while virtual applications are open, the system displays a prompt telling you that you will lose unsaved data. Select **OK** or **Cancel** to acknowledge and close the prompt.
