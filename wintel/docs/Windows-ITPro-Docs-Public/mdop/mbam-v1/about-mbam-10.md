# About MBAM 1.0


Microsoft BitLocker Administration and Monitoring (MBAM) provides a simplified administrative interface to BitLocker drive encryption and offers enhanced protection against data theft or data exposure for computers that are lost or stolen. BitLocker encrypts all data that is stored on the Windows operating system volume and configured data volumes, which includes the Windows operating system, hibernation and paging files, applications, and the data that is used by applications.

With Microsoft BitLocker Administration and Monitoring, you can select the BitLocker encryption policy options that are appropriate for your enterprise so that you can monitor the client compliance with those policies and then report the encryption status of both the enterprise and individual computers. In addition, you can access recovery key information when users forget their PIN or password or when their BIOS or boot record changes.

**Note**  
BitLocker is not covered in detail in this guide. For an overview of BitLocker, see [BitLocker Drive Encryption Overview](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=225013).

 

The following groups might be interested in using MBAM to manage BitLocker:

-   Administrators, IT security professionals, and compliance officers who are tasked with ensuring that confidential data is not disclosed without authorization
