# Manage device account password rotation

You can configure Surface Hub 2S to automatically change a device account password without requiring you to manually update the device account information.

If you turn on Password Rotation, Surface Hub 2S changes the password every 7 days. The automatically generated passwords contain 15-32 characters including  a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.

Passwords do not change during a meeting. If Surface Hub 2S is turned off, it attempts to change the password immediately when turned on or every 10 minutes until successful.
