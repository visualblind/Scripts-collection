# Manage corporate devices


**Applies to**

-   Windows 10
-   Windows 10 Mobile

You can use the same management tools to manage all device types running Windows 10 : desktops, laptops, tablets, and phones. And your current management tools, such as Group Policy, Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI), PowerShell scripts, System Center tools, and so on, will continue to work for Windows 10.
