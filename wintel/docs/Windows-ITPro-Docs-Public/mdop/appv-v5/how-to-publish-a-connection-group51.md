# How to Publish a Connection Group


After you create a connection group, you must publish it to computers that run the App-V client.

**To publish a connection group**

1.  Open the App-V Management Console, and select **CONNECTION GROUPS**.

2.  Right-click the connection group to be published, and select **publish**.
