# Windows Hello for Business

In WindowsÂ 10, Windows Hello for Business replaces passwords with strong two-factor authentication on PCs and mobile devices. This authentication consists of a new type of user credential that is tied to a device and uses a biometric or PIN.</br>
Windows Hello for Business lets user authenticate to an Active Directory or Azure Active Directory account.

Windows Hello addresses the following problems with passwords:
-   Strong passwords can be difficult to remember, and users often reuse passwords on multiple sites.
-   Server breaches can expose symmetric network credentials (passwords).
-   Passwords are subject to [replay attacks](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=615673).
-   Users can inadvertently expose their passwords due to [phishing attacks](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/security/threat-protection/intelligence/phishing).

## Prerequisites 

### Cloud Only Deployment
* Windows 10, version 1511 or later
* Microsoft Azure Account
* Azure Active Directory
* Azure Multi-factor authentication
* Modern Management (Intune or supported third-party MDM), *optional*
* Azure AD Premium subscription - *optional*, needed for automatic MDM enrollment when the device joins Azure Active Directory

### Hybrid Deployments
The table shows the minimum requirements for each deployment. For key trust in a multi-domain/multi-forest deployment, the following requirements are applicable for each domain/forest that hosts Windows Hello for business components or is involved in the Kerberos referral process.
