# How to Delete an Application


When you select the **Application** node in the Application Virtualization Client Management Console, the **Results** pane displays a list of applications. You can use the following procedure to delete an application from the **Results** pane, which also removes the application from the cache.

**Note**  
When you delete an application, the selected application will no longer be available to any users on that client. Shortcuts and file type associations are hidden, and the application is deleted from cache. However, if another application refers to data in the file system cache data for the selected application, these items will not be deleted.

After a publishing refresh, the deleted applications will again become available to you.

 

**To delete an application**

1.  Move the cursor to the **Results** pane, right-click the desired application, and select **Delete** from the pop-up menu.

2.  At the confirmation prompt, click **Yes** to remove the application or click **No** to cancel the operation.
