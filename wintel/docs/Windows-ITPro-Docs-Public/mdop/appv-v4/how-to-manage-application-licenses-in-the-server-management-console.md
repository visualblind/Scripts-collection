# How to Manage Application Licenses in the Server Management Console


The Application Virtualization Server Management Console is the interface you use to manage the Application Virtualization platform. From it, you can add, remove, configure, and control application license groups.

**Important**  
If the App-V client Application Source Root (ASR) setting is configured to use any type of streaming source other than the Management Server, for example a Streaming Server, an IIS server, or a File server, then the Management Server is unable to enforce its licensing policy.
