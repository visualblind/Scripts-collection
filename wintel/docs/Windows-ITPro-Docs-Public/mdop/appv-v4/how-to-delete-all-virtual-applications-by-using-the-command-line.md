# How to Delete All Virtual Applications by Using the Command Line

**Note**  
When all applications are deleted from a package, the Application Virtualization (App-V) Client also deletes the package.

 

**To delete all applications**

-   Run the following command to delete all applications for the user account under which the command is run. If you run the command with the optional /GLOBAL switch, using an account with administrative rights, all applications are deleted for all users.

    `SFTMIME DELETE OBJ:APP [/GLOBAL]`
