# Wake On LAN for Surface devices

Surface devices that run Windows 10, version 1607 (also known as Windows 10 Anniversary Update) or later and use a Surface Ethernet adapter to connect to a wired network, are capable of Wake On LAN (WOL) from Connected Standby. With WOL, you can remotely wake up devices to perform management or maintenance tasks or enable management solutions (such as System Center Configuration Manager) automatically. For example, you can deploy applications to Surface devices left docked with a Surface Dock or Surface Pro 3 Docking Station by using System Center Configuration Manager during a window in the middle of the night, when the office is empty.

>[!NOTE]
>Surface devices must be connected to AC power and in Connected Standby (Sleep) to support WOL. WOL is not possible from devices that are in hibernation or powered off.

## Supported devices

The following devices are supported for WOL:

* Surface Ethernet adapter
* Surface USB-C to Ethernet and USB Adapter
* Surface Dock
* Surface Docking Station for Surface Pro 3
* Surface 3
* Surface Pro 3
* Surface Pro 4
* Surface Pro (5th Gen)
* Surface Pro (5th Gen) with LTE Advanced
* Surface Book
* Surface Laptop (1st Gen)
* Surface Pro 6
* Surface Book 2
* Surface Laptop 2
* Surface Go
* Surface Go with LTE Advanced
* Surface Studio (see Surface Studio instructions below)

## WOL driver

To enable WOL support on Surface devices, a specific driver for the Surface Ethernet adapter is required. This driver is not included in the standard driver and firmware pack for Surface devices – you must download and install it separately. You can download the Surface WOL driver (SurfaceWOL.msi) from the [Surface Tools for IT](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=46703) page in the Microsoft Download Center.

You can run this Microsoft Windows Installer (.msi) file on a Surface device to install the Surface WOL driver, or you can distribute it to Surface devices with an application deployment solution, such as System Center Configuration Manager. To include the Surface WOL driver during deployment, you can install the .msi file as an application during the deployment process. You can also extract the Surface WOL driver files to include them in the deployment process. For example, you can include them in your Microsoft Deployment Toolkit (MDT) deployment share. You can read more about Surface deployment with MDT in [Deploy Windows 10 to Surface devices with Microsoft Deployment Toolkit](https://technet.microsoft.com/itpro/surface/deploy-windows-10-to-surface-devices-with-mdt).

> [!NOTE]
> During the installation of SurfaceWOL.msi, the following registry key is set to a value of 1, which allows easy identification of systems where the WOL driver has been installed. If you chose to extract and install these drivers separately during deployment, this registry key will not be configured and must be configured manually or with a script.
> 
> **HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Power AllowSystemRequiredPowerRequests** 

To extract the contents of SurfaceWOL.msi, use the MSIExec administrative installation option (**/a**), as shown in the following example, to extract the contents to the C:\WOL\ folder:

   `msiexec /a surfacewol.msi targetdir=C:\WOL /qn`

## Surface Studio instructions

To enable WOL on Surface Studio, you must use the following procedure

1. Create the following registry keys:

 ```
; Set CONNECTIVITYINSTANDBY to 1:
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Power\PowerSettings\F15576E8-98B7-4186-B944-EAFA664402D9]
"Attributes"=dword:00000001
; Set EnforceDisconnectedStandby to 0 and AllowSystemRequiredPowerRequests to 1:
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Power]
"EnforceDisconnectedStandby"=dword:00000000
"AllowSystemRequiredPowerRequests"=dword:00000001
```

2. Run the following command

    ```powercfg /SETACVALUEINDEX SCHEME_BALANCED SUB_NONE CONNECTIVITYINSTANDBY 1```

## Using Surface WOL

The Surface WOL driver conforms to the WOL standard, whereby the device is woken by a special network communication known as a magic packet. The magic packet consists of 6 bytes of 255 (or FF in hexadecimal) followed by 16 repetitions of the target computer’s MAC address. You can read more about the magic packet and the WOL standard on [Wikipedia](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Wake-on-LAN#Magic_packet).

>[!NOTE]
>To send a magic packet and wake up a device by using WOL, you must know the MAC address of the target device and Ethernet adapter. Because the magic packet does not use the IP network protocol, it is not possible to use the IP address or DNS name of the device.

Many management solutions, such as System Center Configuration Manager, provide built-in support for WOL. There are also many solutions, including Microsoft Store apps, PowerShell modules, third-party applications, and third-party management solutions that allow you to send a magic packet to wake up a device. For example, you can use the [Wake On LAN PowerShell module](https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/scriptcenter/Wake-On-Lan-815424c4) from the TechNet Script Center. 

>[!NOTE]
>After a device has been woken up with a magic packet, the device will return to sleep if an application is not actively preventing sleep on the system or if the AllowSystemRequiredPowerRequests registry key is not configured to 1, which allows applications to prevent sleep. See the [WOL driver](#wol-driver) section of this article for more information about this registry key.
