# How to Apply the User Configuration File by Using PowerShell


The dynamic user configuration file is applied when a package is published to a specific user and determines how the package will run.

Use the following procedure to specify a user-specific configuration file. The following procedure is based on the example:

**c:\\Packages\\Contoso\\MyApp.appv**

**To apply a user Configuration file**

1.  To add the package to the computer using the PowerShell console type the following command:

    **Add-AppVClientPackage c:\\Packages\\Contoso\\MyApp.appv**.

2.  Use the following command to publish the package to the user and specify the updated the dynamic user configuration file:

    **Publish-AppVClientPackage $pkg –DynamicUserConfigurationPath c:\\Packages\\Contoso\\config.xml**
