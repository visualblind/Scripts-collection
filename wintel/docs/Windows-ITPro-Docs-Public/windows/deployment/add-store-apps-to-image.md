# Add Microsoft Store for Business applications to a Windows 10 image

**Applies to**

-   WindowsÂ 10

This topic describes the correct way to add Microsoft Store for Business applications to a Windows 10 image. This will enable you to deploy Windows 10 with pre-installed Microsoft Store for Business apps.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>In order for Microsoft Store for Business applications to persist after image deployment, these applications need to be pinned to Start prior to image deployment.

## Prerequisites

* [Windows Assessment and Deployment Kit (Windows ADK)](windows-adk-scenarios-for-it-pros.md) for the tools required to mount and edit Windows images.

* Download an offline signed app package and license of the application you would like to add through [Microsoft Store for Business](/store-for-business/distribute-offline-apps#download-an-offline-licensed-app).

* A Windows Image. For instructions on image creation, see [Deploy Windows 10 with System Center 2012 R2 Configuration Manager](deploy-windows-sccm/deploy-windows-10-with-system-center-2012-r2-configuration-manager.md) or [Deploy Windows 10 with the Microsoft Deployment Toolkit](deploy-windows-mdt/deploy-windows-10-with-the-microsoft-deployment-toolkit.md).

>[!NOTE]
> If you'd like to add an internal LOB Microsoft Store application, please follow the instructions on **[Sideload LOB apps in Windows 10](/windows/application-management/sideload-apps-in-windows-10)**.

## Adding a Store application to your image

On a machine where your image file is accessible:
1. Open Windows PowerShell with administrator privileges.
2. Mount the image. At the Windows PowerShell prompt, type:
`Mount-WindowsImage -ImagePath c:\images\myimage.wim -Index 1 -Path C:\test`
3. Use the Add-AppxProvisionedPackage cmdlet in Windows PowerShell to preinstall the app. Use the /PackagePath option to specify the location of the Store package and /LicensePath to specify the location of the license .xml file. In Windows PowerShell, type:
`Add-AppxProvisionedPackage -Path C:\test -PackagePath C:\downloads\appxpackage -LicensePath C:\downloads\appxpackage\license.xml`

>[!NOTE]
>Paths and file names are examples. Use your paths and file names where appropriate.
>
>Do not dismount the image, as you will return to it later.

## Editing the Start Layout

In order for Microsoft Store for Business applications to persist after image deployment, these applications need to be pinned to Start prior to image deployment.

On a test machine:
1. **Install the Microsoft Store for Business application you previously added** to your image.
2. **Pin these apps to the Start screen**, by typing the name of the app, right-clicking and selecting **Pin to Start**.
3. Open Windows PowerShell with administrator privileges.
4. Use `Export-StartLayout -path <path><file name>.xml` where *\<path>\<file name>* is the path and name of the xml file your will later import into your Windows Image.
5. Copy the XML file you created to a location accessible by the machine you previously used to add Store applications to your image.

Now, on the machine where your image file is accessible:
1. Import the Start layout. At the Windows PowerShell prompt, type: 
`Import-StartLayout -LayoutPath "<path><file name>.xml" -MountPath "C:\test\"`
2. Save changes and dismount the image. At the Windows PowerShell prompt, type:
`Dismount-WindowsImage -Path c:\test -Save`
