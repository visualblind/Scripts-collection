# How to Load or Unload an Application


You can use the following procedures to load or unload an application from the cache, directly from the **Results** pane of the **Application** node in the Application Virtualization Client Management Console. When you select this node, the **Results** pane displays a list of applications.

**Note**  
When you load or unload a package, all the applications in the package are loaded into or removed from cache. When loading a package, if you do not have adequate space in cache to load the applications, increase your cache size. For more information about cache size, see [How to Change the Cache Size and the Drive Letter Designation](how-to-change-the-cache-size-and-the-drive-letter-designation.md).

 

**To load an application**

1.  Move the cursor to the **Results** pane, right-click the desired application, and select **Load** from the pop-up menu.

2.  The application is automatically loaded. The progress is tracked in the column labeled **Package Status**. You must refresh the view to see that the load is complete or to see the progress.

**To unload an application**

1.  Move the cursor to the **Results** pane, right-click the desired application, and select **Unload** from the pop-up menu.

2.  The application is automatically unloaded, and the **Package Status** column is updated to reflect the change.
