# AGPM Server Tab


The **AGPM Server** tab on the **Change Control** pane enables you to select an AGPM Server by entering a fully-qualified computer name and port. The default port for Advanced Group Policy Management (AGPM) is port 4600.

The AGPM Server selected determines which archive is displayed for you on the **Contents** tab and to which location the **Domain Delegation** settings are applied.

If the AGPM Server connection is centrally configured using Administrative template settings, the options on this tab are unavailable. For more information, see [Configure the AGPM Server Connection](configure-the-agpm-server-connection.md).
