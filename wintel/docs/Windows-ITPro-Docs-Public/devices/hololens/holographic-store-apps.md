# Find, install, and uninstall applications from the Microsoft Store

The Microsoft Store is your go-to source for apps and games that work with HoloLens. When you go to the Store on your HoloLens, any apps you see there will run on it.

Apps on HoloLens use either 2D view or holographic view. Apps that use 2D view look like windows and can be positioned all around you. Apps that use holographic view surround you and become the only app you see.

HoloLens supports many existing applications from the Microsoft Store, as well as new apps built specifically for HoloLens.  This article focuses on holographic applications from the Microsoft Store.

To learn more about installing and running custom apps, read [Custom holographic applications](holographic-custom-apps.md).

## Find apps

Open the Microsoft Store from the **Start** menu. Then browse for apps and games. You can use Cortana to search by saying "Hey, Cortana" and then saying your search terms.

## Install apps

To download apps, you'll need to be signed in with a Microsoft account. To buy them, you'll need a payment method associated with the Microsoft account you use on your HoloLens. To set up a payment method, go to [account.microsoft.com](http://account.microsoft.com/) and select **Payment & billing** > **Payment options** > **Add a payment option**.

1. To open the [**Start** menu](holographic-home.md), perform a [bloom](hololens1-basic-usage.md) gesture or tap your wrist.
2. Select the Store app and then tap to place this tile into your world.
3. Once the Store app opens, use the search bar to look for any desired application.
4. Select **Get** or **Install** on the application's page (a purchase may be required).

## Uninstall apps

There are two ways to uninstall applications.  You can uninstall applications through the Microsoft Store or Start menu.

### Uninstall from the Start menu

On the **Start** menu or in the **All apps** list, gaze at the app. Tap and hold until the menu appears, then select **Uninstall**.

### Uninstall from the Microsoft Store

Open the Microsoft Store from the **Start** menu, and then browse for the application you'd like to uninstall.  On the Store page, each application that you have installed has an **Uninstall** button.
