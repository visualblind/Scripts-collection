# Deploy and enable Windows Defender Antivirus

**Applies to:**

- [Microsoft Defender Advanced Threat Protection (Microsoft Defender ATP)](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2069559)

Depending on the management tool you are using, you may need to specifically enable or configure Windows Defender Antivirus protection.

See the table in [Deploy, manage, and report on Windows Defender Antivirus](deploy-manage-report-windows-defender-antivirus.md#ref2) for instructions on how to enable protection with Microsoft Intune, System Center Configuration Manager, Group Policy, Active Directory, Microsoft Azure, PowerShell cmdlets, and Windows Management Instruction (WMI).

Some scenarios require additional guidance on how to successfully deploy or configure Windows Defender Antivirus protection, such as Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) environments.

The remaining topic in this section provides end-to-end advice and best practices for [setting up Windows Defender Antivirus on virtual machines (VMs) in a VDI or Remote Desktop Services (RDS) environment](deployment-vdi-windows-defender-antivirus.md).
