# About Application Virtualization Servers


Application Virtualization Management Servers, also called *application publishing servers*, control access to the applications that are processed to run in a virtual environment. Virtual applications are stored on the Application Virtualization Management Servers. When a virtual application is called for by the client, the application package is streamed to the client from the Application Virtualization Management Servers.

**Note**  
You can also stream applications to clients from Application Virtualization Streaming Servers. Streaming Servers do not offer some of the services that are available from the Management Servers, such as publishing, management, and reporting.

You can stream applications to the client directly from a file or disk. Some application virtualization deployment scenarios, which are characterized by low or unreliable connectivity or where bandwidth is limited, are ideally suited for streaming from file or disk.

 

One or more Application Virtualization Management Servers that share a single data store make up an *Application Virtualization system*.
