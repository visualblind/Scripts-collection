# Review events and errors using Event Viewer

**Applies to:**

- Event Viewer

- [Microsoft Defender Advanced Threat Protection (Microsoft Defender ATP)](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2069559)



You can review event IDs in the [Event Viewer](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/aa745633(v=bts.10).aspx) on individual machines.

For example, if machines are not appearing in the **Machines list**, you might need to look for event IDs on the machines. You can then use this table to determine further troubleshooting steps.

> [!NOTE]
> It can take several days for machines to begin reporting to the Microsoft Defender ATP service.

**Open Event Viewer and find the Microsoft Defender ATP service event log:**

1. Click **Start** on the Windows menu, type **Event Viewer**, and press **Enter**.

2. In the log list, under **Log Summary**, scroll until you see **Microsoft-Windows-SENSE/Operational**. Double-click the item to
   open the log.

   a.  You can also access the log by expanding **Applications and Services Logs** > **Microsoft** > **Windows** > **SENSE** and click on **Operational**.

   > [!NOTE]
   > SENSE is the internal name used to refer to the behavioral sensor that powers Microsoft Defender ATP.

3. Events recorded by the service will appear in the log. See the following table for a list of events recorded by the service.
