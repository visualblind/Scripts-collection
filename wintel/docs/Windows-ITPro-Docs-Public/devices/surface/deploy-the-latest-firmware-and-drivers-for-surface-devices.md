# Deploy the latest firmware and drivers for Surface devices
Although Surface devices are typically automatically updated with the latest device drivers and firmware via Windows Update, sometimes it's necessary to download and install updates manually, such as during a Windows deployment. 

## Download MSI files
To download MSI files, refer to the following Microsoft Support page:
 
- [Download drivers and firmware for Surface](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4023482/surface-download-drivers-and-firmware-for-surface)<br>
Installation files for administrative tools, drivers for accessories, and updates for Windows are also available for some devices.

## Deploying MSI files
Driver and firmware updates for Surface devices consisting of all required cumulative updates are packaged in separate MSI files for specific versions of Windows 10.

The MSI file names contain useful information including the minimum supported Windows build number required to install the drivers and firmware. For example, to install the drivers contained in SurfaceBook_Win10_17763_19.080.2031.0.msi requires Windows 10 Fall Creators Update version 1709 or later installed on your Surface Book.

To view build numbers for each version, refer to [Windows 10 release information](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/windows-10/release-information).

### Surface MSI naming convention
Beginning in August 2019, MSI files use the following naming formula:

- Product > Windows release > Windows build number > Version number >  Revision of version number (typically zero).

**Example:**
SurfacePro6_Win10_18362_19.073.44195_0.msi :

| Product     | Windows release | Build | Version |  Revision of version |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| SurfacePro6 | Win10  | 18362  | 19.073.44195 | 0  |
|       |      |       | Indicates key date and sequence information.  | Indicates release history of the update.   |
|      |        |     | **19:** Signifies the year (2019).<br>**073**: Signifies the month (July) and week of the release (3).  <br>**44195**: Signifies the minute of the month that the MSI file was created. |**0:**  Signifies it's the first release of version 1907344195 and has not been re-released for any reason. |

### Legacy Surface MSI naming convention
Legacy MSI files prior to August 2019 followed the same overall naming formula but used a different method to derive the version number.  

**Example:**
SurfacePro6_Win10_16299_1900307_0.msi :

| Product     | Windows release | Build | Version |  Revision of version |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| SurfacePro6 | Win10  | 16299  | 1900307 | 0  |
|       |      |       | Indicates key date and sequence information.  | Indicates release history of the MSI file.   |
|      |        |     | **19:** Signifies the year (2019)<br>**003**: Signifies that it’s the third release of 2019.<br>**07**: Signifies the product version number. (Surface Pro 6 is officially the seventh version of Surface Pro.) | **0:** Signifies it's the first release of version 1900307 and has not been re-released for any reason. |

Look to the **version** number to determine the latest files that contain the most recent security updates.  For example, you might need to install the newest file from the following list:


- SurfacePro6_Win10_16299_1900307_0.msi
- SurfacePro6_Win10_17134_1808507_3.msi
- SurfacePro6_Win10_17763_1808707_3.msi

The first file —  SurfacePro6_Win10_16299_1900307_0.msi  —  is the newest because its VERSION field has the newest build in 2019; the other files are from 2018.

## Supported devices
Downloadable MSI files are available for Surface devices from Surface Pro 2 and later.

>[!NOTE]
>There are no downloadable firmware or driver updates available for Surface devices with Windows RT, including Surface RT and Surface 2. Updates can only be applied using Windows Update.
