# How to Localize a MED-V Image


A MED-V image can be localized, either by unpacking a packed image or by downloading an image from the server. All local images appear in the local repository.

A packed image can be unpacked to the local repository by extracting it. It then does not need to be downloaded from the server.

**To extract a MED-V image**

1.  In the **Local Packed Images** pane, select an image.

2.  Right-click, and from the drop-down menu, select **Extract image**.

    The image is extracted to the local drive and can now be used by the local client running on the computer.

**To download a MED-V image**

1.  In the **Packed Images on Server** pane, select the image or version of the image to download.

2.  Click **Download**.

    The image is downloaded to your local computer.

    **Note**  
    The downloaded image will not appear in the **Local Images** pane until you refresh the page. Click Refresh to see the downloaded image in the **Local Images** pane.
