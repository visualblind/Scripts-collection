# Use Enterprise Mode to improve compatibility

> Applies to: WindowsÂ 10

> [!NOTE]
> You've reached the documentation for Microsoft Edge version 45 and earlier. To see the documentation for Microsoft Edge version 77 or later, go to the [Microsoft Edge documentation landing page](https://docs.microsoft.com/DeployEdge/).

If you have specific websites and apps that have compatibility problems with Microsoft Edge, you can use the Enterprise Mode site list so that the websites open in Internet Explorer 11 automatically. Additionally, if you know that your intranet sites aren't going to work correctly with Microsoft Edge, you can set all intranet sites to automatically open using IE11 with the **Send all intranet sites to IE** group policy.

Using Enterprise Mode means that you can continue to use Microsoft Edge as your default browser, while also ensuring that your apps continue working on IE11.

## Enterprise guidance
Microsoft Edge is the default browser experience for Windows 10 and Windows 10 Mobile. However, if you're running web apps that rely on ActiveX controls, continue using Internet Explorer 11 for the web apps to work correctly. If you don't have IE11 installed anymore, you can download it from the Microsoft Store or the [Internet Explorer 11 download page](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=290956). Also, if you use an earlier version of Internet Explorer, upgrade to IE11. 

Windows 7, Windows 8, and Windows 10 support IE11 so that you can continue using legacy apps even as you migrate to Windows 10 and Microsoft Edge.  

If you're having trouble deciding whether Microsoft Edge is right for your organization, then take a look at the infographic about the potential impact of using Microsoft Edge in an organization.
