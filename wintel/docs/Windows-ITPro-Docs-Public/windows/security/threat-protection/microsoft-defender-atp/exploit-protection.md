# Protect devices from exploits

**Applies to:**

* [Microsoft Defender Advanced Threat Protection (Microsoft Defender ATP)](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2069559)

Exploit protection automatically applies a number of exploit mitigation techniques to operating system processes and apps. Exploit protection is supported beginning with Windows 10, version 1709 and Windows Server 2016, version 1803.

> [!TIP]
> You can visit the Windows Defender Testground website at [demo.wd.microsoft.com](https://demo.wd.microsoft.com?ocid=cx-wddocs-testground) to confirm the feature is working and see how it works.

Exploit protection works best with [Microsoft Defender Advanced Threat Protection](../microsoft-defender-atp/microsoft-defender-advanced-threat-protection.md) - which gives you detailed reporting into exploit protection events and blocks as part of the usual [alert investigation scenarios](../microsoft-defender-atp/investigate-alerts.md).

You can [enable exploit protection](enable-exploit-protection.md) on an individual machine, and then use [Group Policy](import-export-exploit-protection-emet-xml.md) to distribute the XML file to multiple devices at once.

When a mitigation is encountered on the machine, a notification will be displayed from the Action Center. You can [customize the notification](customize-attack-surface-reduction.md#customize-the-notification) with your company details and contact information. You can also enable the rules individually to customize what techniques the feature monitors.

You can also use [audit mode](evaluate-exploit-protection.md) to evaluate how exploit protection would impact your organization if it were enabled.

Many of the features in the [Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET)](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/jj653751) have been included in Exploit protection, and you can convert and import existing EMET configuration profiles into Exploit protection. See [Comparison between Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit and Exploit protection](emet-exploit-protection.md) for more information on how Exploit protection supersedes EMET and what the benefits are when considering moving to exploit protection on Windows 10.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you are currently using EMET you should be aware that [EMET reached end of life on July 31, 2018](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/srd/2016/11/03/beyond-emet/). You should consider replacing EMET with exploit protection in Windows 10. You can [convert an existing EMET configuration file into exploit protection](import-export-exploit-protection-emet-xml.md#convert-an-emet-configuration-file-to-an-exploit-protection-configuration-file) to make the migration easier and keep your existing settings.

> [!WARNING]
> Some security mitigation technologies may have compatibility issues with some applications. You should test exploit protection in all target use scenarios by using [audit mode](audit-windows-defender.md) before deploying the configuration across a production environment or the rest of your network.

## Review exploit protection events in the Microsoft Security Center

Microsoft Defender ATP provides detailed reporting into events and blocks as part of its alert investigation scenarios.

You can query Microsoft Defender ATP data by using [Advanced hunting](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-atp/advanced-hunting-windows-defender-advanced-threat-protection). If you're using [audit mode](audit-windows-defender.md), you can use Advanced hunting to see how exploit protection settings could affect your environment.

Here is an example query:

```PowerShell
MiscEvents
| where ActionType startswith 'ExploitGuard' and ActionType !contains 'NetworkProtection'
```

## Review exploit protection events in Windows Event Viewer

You can review the Windows event log to see events that are created when exploit protection blocks (or audits) an app:

Security-Mitigations | 1 | ACG audit
Security-Mitigations | 2 | ACG enforce

Security-Mitigations | 23 | ROP SimExec audit
Security-Mitigations | 24 | ROP SimExec enforce
WER-Diagnostics | 5 | CFG Block
Win32K | 260 | Untrusted Font

## Mitigation comparison

The mitigations available in EMET are included natively in Windows 10 (starting with version 1709) and Windows Server 2016 (starting with version 1803), under [Exploit protection](exploit-protection.md).

The table in this section indicates the availability and support of native mitigations between EMET and exploit protection.
