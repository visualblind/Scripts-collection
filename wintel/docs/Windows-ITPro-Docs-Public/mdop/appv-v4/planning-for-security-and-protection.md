# Planning for Security and Protection


As an infrastructure administrator, you must provide a secure, productive, and supportable, environment. Security for the Microsoft Application Virtualization (App-V) system relies on proper setup of the software and the environment in which it operates. This section of the Planning and Deployment Guide provides guidance for configuring the various App-V components to enhance the security of your environment. You should carefully consider the exposure and attack surface of your App-V environment before deciding to deploy a system without applying the security recommendations outlined in this section.
