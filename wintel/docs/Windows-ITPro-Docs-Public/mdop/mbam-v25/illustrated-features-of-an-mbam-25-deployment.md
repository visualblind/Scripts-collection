# Illustrated Features of an MBAM 2.5 Deployment


This topic describes the individual features that make up a Microsoft BitLocker Administration and Monitoring (MBAM) 2.5 deployment for the following topologies:

-   MBAM Stand-alone

-   System Center Configuration Manager Integration

**Important**  
These features do not represent the recommended architecture for deploying MBAM. Use this information only as a guide to understand the individual features that make up an MBAM deployment. See [High-Level Architecture for MBAM 2.5](high-level-architecture-for-mbam-25.md) for the recommended architecture for MBAM.



For a list of the supported versions of the software mentioned in this topic, see [MBAM 2.5 Supported Configurations](mbam-25-supported-configurations.md).

|SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS)|Reports are configured in an SSRS database instance. Reports can be viewed directly from SSRS or from the Administration and Monitoring Website.|This feature is configured on a server running Windows Server and a supported SQL Server instance that is running SSRS.|
|Self-Service Server|||
|Self-Service Web Service|This web service is used by the MBAM Client and the Administration and Monitoring Website and Self-Service Portal to communicate to the Recovery Database.|This feature is installed on a computer running Windows Server.|
|Self-Service Website (Self-Service Portal)|This website enables end users on client computers to independently sign in to a website to get a recovery key if they lose or forget their BitLocker password.|This feature is configured on a computer running Windows Server.|
|Administration and Monitoring Server|||
|Administration and Monitoring Web Service|The Monitoring Web Service is used by the MBAM Client and the websites to communicate to the databases.|This feature is installed on a computer running Windows Server.|

**Important**  
The Self-Service Web Service is no longer available in Microsoft BitLocker Administration and Monitoring (MBAM) 2.5 SP1, in which the MBAM Client, the Administration and Monitoring Website, and the Self-Service Portal communicate directly with the Recovery Database.

**Important**  
The Monitoring Web Service is no longer available in Microsoft BitLocker Administration and Monitoring (MBAM) 2.5 SP1 since the MBAM Client and the websites communicate directly with the Recovery Database.
