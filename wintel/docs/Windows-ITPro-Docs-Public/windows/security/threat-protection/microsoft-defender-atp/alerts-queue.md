# View and organize the Microsoft Defender Advanced Threat Protection Alerts queue

**Applies to:**
- [Microsoft Defender Advanced Threat Protection (Microsoft Defender ATP)](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2069559)

>Want to experience Microsoft Defender ATP? [Sign up for a free trial.](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/windows/microsoft-defender-atp?ocid=docs-wdatp-alertsq-abovefoldlink) 

The **Alerts queue** shows a list of alerts that were flagged from machines in your network. By default, the queue displays alerts seen in the last 30 days in a grouped view, with the most recent alerts showing at the top of the list, helping you see the most recent alerts first.

There are several options you can choose from to customize the alerts queue view. 

On the top navigation you can:
- Select grouped view or list view
- Customize columns to add or remove columns 
- Select the items to show per page
- Navigate between pages
- Apply filters

## Sort, filter, and group the alerts queue
You can apply the following filters to limit the list of alerts and get a more focused view the alerts.

### Severity

Alert severity | Description
:---|:---
High </br>(Red) | Threats often associated with advanced persistent threats (APT). These alerts indicate a high risk due to the severity of damage they can inflict on machines.
Medium </br>(Orange) | Threats rarely observed in the organization, such as anomalous registry change, execution of suspicious files, and observed behaviors typical of attack stages.
Low </br>(Yellow) | Threats associated with prevalent malware and hack-tools that do not necessarily indicate an advanced threat targeting the organization.
Informational </br>(Grey) | Informational alerts are those that might not be considered harmful to the network but might be good to keep track of.

#### Understanding alert severity
It is important to understand that the Windows Defender Antivirus (Windows Defender AV) and Microsoft Defender ATP alert severities are different because they represent different scopes.

The Windows Defender AV threat severity represents the absolute severity of the detected threat (malware), and is assigned based on the potential risk to the individual machine, if infected.

The Microsoft Defender ATP alert severity represents the severity of the detected behavior, the actual risk to the machine but more importantly the potential risk to the organization.

So, for example:
- The severity of a Microsoft Defender ATP alert about a Windows Defender AV detected threat that was completely prevented and did not infect the machine is categorized as "Informational" because there was no actual damage incurred.
- An alert about a commercial malware was detected while executing, but blocked and remediated by Windows Defender AV, is categorized as  "Low" because it may have caused some damage to the individual machine but poses no organizational threat.
- An alert about malware detected while executing which can pose a threat not only to the individual machine but to the organization, regardless if it was eventually blocked, may be ranked as "Medium" or "High".
- Suspicious behavioral alerts which were not blocked or remediated will be ranked "Low", "Medium" or "High" following the same organizational threat considerations.

#### Understanding alert categories
We've redefined the alert categories to align to the [enterprise attack tactics](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/enterprise/) in the [MITRE ATT&CK matrix](https://attack.mitre.org/). New category names apply to all new alerts. Existing alerts will retain the previous category names.

The table below lists the current categories and how they generally map to previous categories. 

| New category | Previous categories | Detected threat activity or component |
|----------------------|----------------------|-------------|
| Collection           | - | Locating and collecting data for exfiltration |
| Command and control  | CommandAndControl | Connecting to attacker-controlled network infrastructure to relay data or receive commands |
| Credential access    | CredentialTheft | Obtaining valid credentials to extend control over devices and other resources in the network |
| Defense evasion      | - | Avoiding security controls by, for example, turning off security apps, deleting implants, and running rootkits |
| Discovery            | Reconnaissance, WebFingerprinting | Gathering information about important devices and resources, such as administrator computers, domain controllers, and file servers |
| Execution            | Delivery, MalwareDownload | Launching attacker tools and malicious code, including RATs and backdoors |
| Exfiltration         | Exfiltration | Extracting data from the network to an external, attacker-controlled location |
| Exploit              | Exploit | Exploit code and possible exploitation activity |
| Initial access       | SocialEngineering, WebExploit, DocumentExploit | Gaining initial entry to the target network, usually involving password-guessing, exploits, or phishing emails |
| Lateral movement     | LateralMovement, NetworkPropagation | Moving between devices in the target network to reach critical resources or gain network persistence |
| Malware              | Malware, Backdoor, Trojan, TrojanDownloader, CredentialStealing, Weaponization, RemoteAccessTool | Backdoors, trojans, and other types of malicious code |
| Persistence          | Installation, Persistence | Creating autostart extensibility points (ASEPs) to remain active and survive system restarts |
| Privilege escalation | PrivilegeEscalation | Obtaining higher permission levels for code by running it in the context of a privileged process or account |
| Ransomware           | Ransomware | Malware that encrypts files and extorts payment to restore access |
| Suspicious activity  | General, None, NotApplicable, EnterprisePolicy, SuspiciousNetworkTraffic | Atypical activity that could be malware activity or part of an attack |
| Unwanted software    | UnwantedSoftware | Low-reputation apps and apps that impact productivity and the user experience; detected as potentially unwanted applications (PUAs) |


### Status
You can choose to limit the list of alerts based on their status.

### Investigation state
Corresponds to the automated investigation state.

### Category
You can choose to filter the queue to display specific types of malicious activity.

### Assigned to
You can choose between showing alerts that are assigned to you or automation.

### Detection source
Select the source that triggered the alert detection.  Microsoft Threat Experts preview participants can now filter and see detections from the new threat experts managed hunting service.

>[!NOTE]
>The Windows Defender Antivirus filter will only appear if machines are using Windows Defender Antivirus as the default real-time protection antimalware product.


### OS platform
Limit the alerts queue view by selecting the OS platform that you're interested in investigating.

### Machine group
If you have specific machine groups that you're interested in checking the alerts on, you can select the groups to limit the alerts queue view to display just those machine groups.

### Associated threat
Use this filter to focus on alerts that are related to high profile threats. You can see the full list of high-profile threats in [Threat analytics](threat-analytics.md).
