~~~
If you get this error when calling Microsoft Defender ATP API, your token might not include the necessary permission.

Check [app permissions](exposed-apis-create-app-webapp.md#validate-the-token) or [delegated permissions](exposed-apis-create-app-nativeapp.md#validate-the-token) included in your token.

If the 'roles' section in the token does not include the necessary permission: 

- The necessary permission to your app might not have been granted. For more information, see [Access Microsoft Defender ATP without a user](exposed-apis-create-app-webapp.md#create-an-app) or [Access Microsoft Defender ATP on behalf of a user](exposed-apis-create-app-nativeapp.md#create-an-app) or,
- The app was not authorized in the tenant, see [Application consent](exposed-apis-create-app-webapp.md#application-consent).
