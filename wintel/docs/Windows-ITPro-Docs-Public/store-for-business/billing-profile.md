# Understand billing profiles
For commercial customers purchasing software or hardware products from Microsoft using a Microsoft customer agreement, billing profiles let you customize what products are included on your invoice, and how you pay your invoices. 

Billing profiles include:
- **Payment methods** – Credit cards or check/wire transfer
- **Contact info** - Billing address and a contact name
- **Permissions** – Permissions that allow you to change the billing profile, pay bills, or use the payment method on the billing profile to make purchases

Use billing profiles to control your purchases and customize your invoice. A monthly invoice is generated for the products bought using the billing profile. You can customize the invoice such as update the purchase order number and email invoice preference.

A billing profile is automatically created for your billing account during your first purchase. You can create new billing profiles to set up additional invoices when you make a purchase. For example, you use different billing profiles when you make purchases for each department in your organization. On your next billing date, you'll receive an invoice for each billing profile. 

Roles on the billing profiles have permissions to control purchases, and view and manage invoices. Assign these roles to users who track, organize, and pay invoices like members of the procurement team in your organization. 

## View billing profile
**To view billing profiles**
1. Sign in to [Microsoft Store for Business]( https://businessstore.microsoft.com/), or M365 admin center. 
2. Select **Manage**, and then select **Billing and payments**. 
3. Select **Billing profiles**, and then select a billing profile from the list to see details.
    - On **Overview**, you can edit billing profile details, and turn on or off sending an invoice by email.
    - On **Permissions**, you can assign roles to users to pay invoices.
    - On **Azure credit balance**, Azure customers can see transaction balance history for the azure credits used by that billing profile.
    - On **Azure credits**, Azure customers can see a list of Azure credits associated with that billing profile, and their expiration dates.
