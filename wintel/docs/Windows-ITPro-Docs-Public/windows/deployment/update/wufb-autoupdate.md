# Set up Automatic Update in Windows Update for Business with group policies

>Applies to: Windows 10

Use the Automatic Update group policies to manage the interaction between Windows Update and clients.

Automatic Update governs the "behind the scenes" download and installation processes. It's important to keep in mind the device limitation in your environment as the download and install process can consume processing power. The below section outlines the ideal configuration for devices with the least amount of user experience degradation.

|Policy|Description |
|-|-|
|Configure Automatic Updates|Governs the installation activity that happens in the background. This allows you to configure the installation to happen during the [maintenance window](https://docs.microsoft.com/sccm/core/clients/manage/collections/use-maintenance-windows). Also, you can specify an installation time where the device will also try to install the latest packages. You can also pick a certain day and or week.|
|Automatic Update Detection Frequency|Lets you set the scan frequency the device will use to connect to Windows Update to see if there is any available content. Default is 22 hours, but you can increase or decrease the frequency. Keep in mind a desktop computer may need to scan less frequently than laptops, which can have intermittent internet connection.|
|Specify Intranet Microsoft Update Service Location|Used for Windows Server Update Services or System Center Configuration Manager users who want to install custom packages that are not offered through Windows Update.|
|Do not connect to any Windows Update Internet locations <br>Required for Dual Scan|Prevents access to Windows Update.|

## Suggested configuration

|Policy|Location|Suggested configuration|
|-|-|-|
|Configure Automatic Updates|	GPO: Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > Windows Components > Windows Update > Configure Automatic Updates|	**Attention**: If you are using this policy, don't set it/configure it to get the default behavior. If you have set this policy, delete the reg key. This ensures the device uses the default behavior. Note that this is not the same as the default setting within the policy.<br><br> **Default behavior**: Download and installation happen automatically. The device will then be in a pending reboot state. <br><br>**Pro tip**: You can configure the scan frequency to be more frequent with the policy below.|
|Automatic Update Detection Frequency|GPO: Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > Windows Components > Windows Update > Automatic Updates detection frequency|State: Enabled <br>**Check for updates on the following interval (hours)**: 22|
|Do not connect to any Windows Update Internet locations (Required for Dual Scan) |	GPO: Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > Windows Components > Windows Update > Do not connect to any Windows Update Internet locations	|State: Disabled |
