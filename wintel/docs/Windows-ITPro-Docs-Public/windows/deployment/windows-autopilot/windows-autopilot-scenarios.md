# Windows Autopilot scenarios and capabilities

**Applies to: WindowsÂ 10**

## Scenarios

Windows Autopilot includes support for a growing list of scenarios, designed to support common organization needs which can vary based on the type of organization and their progress moving to Windows 10 and [transitioning to modern management](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/client-management/manage-windows-10-in-your-organization-modern-management).

The following Windows Autopilot scenarios are described in this guide:

| Scenario | More information |
| --- | --- |
| Deploy devices that will be set up by a member of the organization and configured for that person | [Windows Autopilot user-driven mode](user-driven.md) |
| Deploy devices that will be automatically configured for shared use, as a kiosk, or as a digital signage device.| [Windows Autopilot self-deploying mode](self-deploying.md) |
| Re-deploy a device in a business-ready state.| [Windows Autopilot Reset](windows-autopilot-reset.md) |
| Pre-provision a device with up-to-date applications, policies and settings.| [White glove](white-glove.md) |
| Deploy Windows 10 on an existing Windows 7 or 8.1 device | [Windows Autopilot for existing devices](existing-devices.md) |

## Windows Autopilot capabilities

### Windows Autopilot is self-updating during OOBE

Starting with the Windows 10, version 1903, Autopilot functional and critical updates will begin downloading automatically during OOBE after a device gets connected to a network and the [critical driver and Windows zero-day patch (ZDP) updates](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/customize/desktop/windows-updates-during-oobe) have completed. The user or IT admin cannot opt-out of these Autopilot updates; they are required for Windows Autopilot deployment to operate properly.  Windows will alert the user that the device is checking for, downloading and installing the updates.

### Cortana voiceover and speech recognition during OOBE

In Windows 10, version 1903 and later Cortana voiceover and speech recognition during OOBE is DISABLED by default for all Windows 10 Pro, Education and Enterprise SKUs.

If desired, you can enable Cortana voiceover and speech recognition during OOBE by creating the following registry key. This key does not exist by default.

HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\OOBE\EnableVoiceForAllEditions

The key value is a DWORD with  **0** = disabled and **1** = enabled.

| Value | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | Cortana voiceover is disabled |
| 1 | Cortana voiceover is enabled |
| No value | Device will fall back to default behavior of the edition |

To change this key value, use WCD tool to create as PPKG as documented [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/configuration/wcd/wcd-oobe#nforce).

### Bitlocker encryption

With Windows Autopilot, you can configure the BitLocker encryption settings to be applied before automatic encryption is started. For more information, see [Setting the BitLocker encryption algorithm for Autopilot devices](bitlocker.md)
