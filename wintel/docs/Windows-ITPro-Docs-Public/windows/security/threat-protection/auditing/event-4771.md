***Subcategory:***&nbsp;[Audit Kerberos Authentication Service](audit-kerberos-authentication-service.md)

***Event Description:***

This event generates every time the Key Distribution Center fails to issue a Kerberos Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT). This can occur when a domain controller doesn’t have a certificate installed for smart card authentication (for example, with a “Domain Controller” or “Domain Controller Authentication” template), the user’s password has expired, or the wrong password was provided.

This event generates only on domain controllers.

This event is not generated if “Do not require Kerberos preauthentication” option is set for the account.

> **Note**&nbsp;&nbsp;For recommendations, see [Security Monitoring Recommendations](#security-monitoring-recommendations) for this event.

***Required Server Roles:*** Active Directory domain controller.

***Minimum OS Version:*** Windows Server 2008.

***Event Versions:*** 0.

***Field Descriptions:***

**Account Information:**

-   **Security ID** \[Type = SID\]**:** SID of account object for which (TGT) ticket was requested. Event Viewer automatically tries to resolve SIDs and show the account name. If the SID cannot be resolved, you will see the source data in the event.

    For example: CONTOSO\\dadmin or CONTOSO\\WIN81$.

> **Note**&nbsp;&nbsp;A **security identifier (SID)** is a unique value of variable length used to identify a trustee (security principal). Each account has a unique SID that is issued by an authority, such as an Active Directory domain controller, and stored in a security database. Each time a user logs on, the system retrieves the SID for that user from the database and places it in the access token for that user. The system uses the SID in the access token to identify the user in all subsequent interactions with Windows security. When a SID has been used as the unique identifier for a user or group, it cannot ever be used again to identify another user or group. For more information about SIDs, see [Security identifiers](/windows/access-protection/access-control/security-identifiers).

-   **Account Name:** \[Type = UnicodeString\]**:** the name of account, for which (TGT) ticket was requested. Computer account name ends with **$** character.

    -   User account example: dadmin

    -   Computer account example: WIN81$

**Service Information:**

-   **Service Name** \[Type = UnicodeString\]: the name of the service in the Kerberos Realm to which TGT request was sent. Typically has one of the following formats:

    -   krbtgt/DOMAIN\_NETBIOS\_NAME. Example: krbtgt/CONTOSO

    -   krbtgt/DOMAIN\_FULL\_NAME. Example: krbtgt/CONTOSO.LOCAL

**Network Information:**

-   **Client Address** \[Type = UnicodeString\]**:** IP address of the computer from which the TGT request was received. Formats vary, and include the following:

    -   **IPv6** or **IPv4** address.

    -   **::ffff:IPv4\_address**.

    -   **::1** - localhost.

-   **Client Port** \[Type = UnicodeString\]: source port number of client network connection (TGT request connection).

    -   0 for local (localhost) requests.

**Additional Information:**

-   **Ticket Options**: \[Type = HexInt32\]: this is a set of different Ticket Flags in hexadecimal format.

    Example:

    -   Ticket Options: 0x40810010

    -   Binary view: 01000000100000010000000000010000

    -   Using **MSB 0** bit numbering we have bit 1, 8, 15 and 27 set = Forwardable, Renewable, Canonicalize, Renewable-ok.

> **Note**&nbsp;&nbsp;In the table below **“MSB 0”** bit numbering is used, because RFC documents use this style. In “MSB 0” style bit numbering begins from left.<br><img src="images/msb.png" alt="MSB illustration" width="224" height="57" />

The most common values:

-   0x40810010 - Forwardable, Renewable, Canonicalize, Renewable-ok

-   0x40810000 - Forwardable, Renewable, Canonicalize

-   0x60810010 - Forwardable, Forwarded, Renewable, Canonicalize, Renewable-ok

| 1     | Forwardable              | (TGT only).

Tickets issued without the performance of this check will be noted by the reset (0) value of the TRANSITED-POLICY-CHECKED flag, indicating to the application server that the transited field must be checked locally.

-   You can track all [4771](event-4771.md) events where the **Client Address** is not from your internal IP range or not from private IP ranges.

-   If you know that **Account Name** should be used only from known list of IP addresses, track all **Client Address** values for this **Account Name** in [4771](event-4771.md) events. If **Client Address** is not from the whitelist, generate the alert.

-   All **Client Address** = ::1 means local authentication. If you know the list of accounts which should log on to the domain controllers, then you need to monitor for all possible violations, where **Client Address** = ::1 and **Account Name** is not allowed to log on to any domain controller.

-   All [4771](event-4771.md) events with **Client Port** field value &gt; 0 and &lt; 1024 should be examined, because a well-known port was used for outbound connection.

-   Also monitor the fields shown in the following table, to discover the issues listed:

| **Field**                   | **Issue to discover**                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Pre-Authentication Type** | Value is **not 15** when account must use a smart card for authentication. For more information, see [Table 5. Kerberos Pre-Authentication types](#kerberos-preauthentication-types).                                        |
| **Pre-Authentication Type** | Value is **not 2** when only standard password authentication is in use in the organization. For more information, see [Table 5. Kerberos Pre-Authentication types](#kerberos-preauthentication-types).                      |
| **Pre-Authentication Type** | Value is **not 138** when Kerberos Armoring is enabled for all Kerberos communications in the organization. For more information, see [Table 5. Kerberos Pre-Authentication types](#kerberos-preauthentication-types).       |
| **Result Code**             | **0x10** (KDC has no support for PADATA type (pre-authentication data)). This error can help you to more quickly identify smart-card related problems with Kerberos authentication.                                          |
| **Result Code**             | **0x18** ((Pre-authentication information was invalid), if you see, for example N events in last N minutes. This can be an indicator of brute-force attack on the account password, especially for highly critical accounts. |
