# Which editions of Windows support advanced audit policy configuration

**Applies to**
-   WindowsÂ 10

Advanced audit policy configuration is supported on all versions of Windows since it was introduced in Windows Vista. 
There is no difference in security auditing support between 32-bit and 64-bit versions. 
Windows editions that cannot join a domain, such as Windows 10 Home edition, do not have access to these features.
