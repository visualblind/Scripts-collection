# Audit Group Membership

**Applies to**
-   Windows 10
-   Windows Server 2016


Audit Group Membership enables you to audit group memberships when they are enumerated on the client computer.

This policy allows you to audit the group membership information in the user's logon token. Events in this subcategory are generated on the computer on which a logon session is created.

For an interactive logon, the security audit event is generated on the computer that the user logged on to. For a network logon, such as accessing a shared folder on the network, the security audit event is generated on the computer hosting the resource.

You must also enable the [Audit Logon](audit-logon.md) subcategory.

Multiple events are generated if the group membership information cannot fit in a single security audit event

**Event volume**:

-   Low on a client computer.

-   Medium on a domain controller or network servers.
