# Manage software purchased with Microsoft Products and Services agreement in Microsoft Store for Business

**Applies to**

-   Windows 10
-   Windows 10 Mobile

Software purchased with the Microsoft Products and Services Agreement (MPSA) can now be managed in Microsoft Store for Business. This allows customers to manage online software purchases in one location.

There are a couple of things you might need to set up to manage MPSA software purchases in Store for Business.

**To manage MPSA software in Microsoft Store for Business**
1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Store for Business](https://businessstore.microsoft.com).
2. Click **Manage**, and then click **My Organization**.
3. Click **Connected tenants** to see purchasing accounts and the tenants that they are connected to.

## Add tenant
The tenant or tenants that are added to your purchasing account control how you can distribute software to people in your organization. If there isn't a tenant listed for your purchasing account, you'll need to add one before you can use or manage the software you've purchased. When we give you a list to choose from, tenants are grouped by domain.

**To add a tenant to a purchasing account**
1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Store for Business](https://businessstore.microsoft.com).
2. Click **Manage**, and then click **My Organization**.
3. Click **Connected tenants**, and then click the ellipses for a purchasing account without a tenant listed.
4. Click **Choose a tenant**, and then click **Submit**.

If you don't see your tenant in the list, you can add the name of your tenant

**To add the name of your tenant**
1. On **Add a tenant**, click **Don't see your tenant?**.
2. Enter a domain name, and then click **Next**, and then click **Done**.

You'll need to get permissions for the admin that manages the domain you want to add. We'll take you to Business Center Portal where you can manage permissions and roles. The admin will need to be the **Account Manager**.

## Add global admin
In some cases, we might not have info on who the global admin is for the tenant that you select. It might be that the tenant is unmanaged, and you'll need to identify a global admin. Or, you might only need to share account info for the global admin.

If you need to nominate someone to be the global admin, they need sufficient permissions:
- someone who can distribute software
- in Business Center Portal (BCP), it should be someone with **Agreement Admin** role

**To add a global admin to a tenant**

We'll ask for a global admin if we need that info when you add a tenant to a purchasing account. You'd see the request for a global admin before returning to **Store for Business**.

-  On **Add a Global Admin**, click **Make me the Global Admin**, and then click **Submit**.
-or-
-  On **Add a Global Admin**, type a name in **Invite someone else**, and then click **Submit**.
