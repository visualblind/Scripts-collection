# How to Configure Streaming Server Security Post-Installation


Configure the App-V Streaming Server for enhanced security through the registry. As with the App-V Management Server, a certificate must be correctly provisioned with the correct EKU identifier for Server Authentication before you complete the following post-installation procedure.

**To configure Streaming Server security post-installation**

1.  Create an MMC, add the **Certificates** snap-in, and select **Local Machine certificate store**.

2.  Open the **Personal** certificates for the computer, and open the certificate provisioned for App-V.

3.  On the **Details** tab, scroll down to the thumbprint and copy the hash in the details pane.

4.  Open the registry editor, and navigate to `HKLM\Software\Microsoft\SoftGrid\4.5\Distribution server`.

5.  Edit the `X509CertHash` value, paste the thumbprint hash in the value field, and remove all spaces. Click **OK** to accept the edit.

6.  In the registry editor, navigate to `HKLM\Software\Microsoft\SoftGrid\4.5\Distribution server\RtspsPorts`.

7.  Create a new **DWORD** value named "322," and then enter the decimal value as 322 or the hexadecimal value as 142.

8.  Restart the streaming service.
