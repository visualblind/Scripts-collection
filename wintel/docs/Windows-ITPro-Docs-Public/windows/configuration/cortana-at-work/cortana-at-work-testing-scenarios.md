# Testing scenarios using Cortana in your business or organization
**Applies to:**

-   Windows 10, version 1703
-   Windows 10 Mobile, version 1703

We've come up with a list of suggested testing scenarios that you can use to test Cortana in your organization. After you complete all the scenarios, you should be able to:

- [Sign-in to Cortana using Azure AD, manage entries in the notebook, and search for content across your device, Bing, and the cloud, using Cortana](cortana-at-work-scenario-1.md)

- [Perform a quick search with Cortana at work](cortana-at-work-scenario-2.md)

- [Set a reminder and have it remind you when you’ve reached a specific location](cortana-at-work-scenario-3.md)

- [Search for your upcoming meetings on your work calendar](cortana-at-work-scenario-4.md)

- [Send an email to a co-worker from your work email app](cortana-at-work-scenario-5.md)

- [Review a reminder suggested by Cortana based on what you’ve promised in email](cortana-at-work-scenario-6.md)

- [Use Windows Information Protection (WIP) to secure content on a device and then try to manage your organization’s entries in the notebook](cortana-at-work-scenario-7.md)

>[!IMPORTANT]
>The data created as part of these scenarios will be uploaded to Microsoft’s Cloud to help Cortana learn and help your employees. This is the same info that Cortana uses in the consumer offering.
